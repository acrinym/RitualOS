# RitualOS Pitch Deck

## Vision
RitualOS is a modern operating system designed specifically for witches, energy workers, and other spiritual practitioners. It provides a streamlined console for recording rituals, tracking magical ingredients, and maintaining a dream journal and client CRM.

## Problem
Many practitioners rely on scattered notes and spreadsheets that do not integrate ritual history with inventory or client interactions. This makes it difficult to maintain continuity and review progress over time.

## Solution
RitualOS offers:
- Structured ritual logging with moon phases and outcome tracking
- Inventory management with alerts when supplies run low or expire
- Dream logging with symbolic tagging and interpretation notes
- A lightweight client CRM to track sessions and energy work
- Calendar views to visualize past rituals alongside dreams and client work

## Business Model
The core app is free with offline storage. A Pro tier unlocks theme customization, PDF/CSV export, and additional integrations.

## Roadmap
1. MVP with ritual logging and inventory tracking
2. Dream log and basic CRM features
3. Export and syncing options
4. Community contributed ritual templates and marketplace listings

## Ask
We seek feedback from practitioners and early adopters to refine the workflow and interface. Contributions and feature requests are welcome!

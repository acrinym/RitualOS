# Magical Titles

Different paths of magic use a variety of honorifics. These titles can reflect training, lineage, or simply the role you most identify with. Here are a few common ones:

- **Witch** – Often used in Wiccan and folk traditions for anyone practicing spellwork or nature-based rituals.
- **Magician** – A practitioner of ceremonial or ritual magic who might draw on complex symbolism and ritual tools.
- **Sorcerer / Sorceress** – Someone who harnesses personal power and spirit alliances to influence the world.
- **Mage** – A general term for a magical practitioner, sometimes associated with fantasy or game culture.
- **Priest / Priestess** – A title of service, typically within a coven or temple structure.
- **Adept** – Indicates advanced study or initiation within an order such as the Golden Dawn.

### Finding Your Own Title
Consider the style of practice that resonates with you and the community you engage with. Some practitioners use multiple titles depending on context. Others prefer a unique label. There's no single correct answer—choose what feels empowering!

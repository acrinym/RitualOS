# Accessibility Features

RitualOS strives to be usable by everyone. Recent updates include:

- **Keyboard Navigation** – Use `Alt+1` through `Alt+0` to jump between main tabs.
- **Screen Reader Labels** – Buttons and tabs now expose accessible names for better narration.
- **High Contrast Theme** – Select **Theme.HighContrast.xaml** from the theme menu for a bright, high contrast palette.

These improvements help practitioners navigate RitualOS more easily regardless of ability.

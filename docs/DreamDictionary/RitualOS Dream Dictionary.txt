A
🜁 SYMBOL: Abandon 🌬️
Reinterpretation:

To dream of being left behind is to feel the anchor lift in the heart's harbor. It speaks of a fear rooted in the earth of you, a terror of standing alone. Yet, it can also be a sacred command: to abandon what is false, to shed the skin of old attachments, and leave the shore of the known. To be the one who leaves is to wield a clean, sharp blade. Use it with care, lest you sever the lifeline from the weight. This symbol forces a confrontation with what truly supports you versus what you merely lean upon.

🜁 SYMBOL: Abbey 🏛️
Reinterpretation:

The Abbey is a structure of the soul, a chamber of quiet contemplation. Its appearance in the dreamscape speaks to your relationship with the sacred, with inner authority, and with self-imposed discipline. To see it in ruins is to witness the crumbling of old beliefs. The structure that once gave you meaning is no longer sound. This is a call to build a new temple within. To be denied entry by a priest is to be turned away from your own spirit by a gatekeeper of your own making. To enter is to begin a period of deep introspection, a turning away from the outer world that can feel like an illness to the ego.

🜁 SYMBOL: Abbess ♀️
Reinterpretation:

The Abbess is the matriarch of the soul's order, the keeper of the inner temple. She embodies feminine spiritual authority, sacred discipline, and compassionate guidance. To meet her is to confront the principle of spiritual order within yourself. If she assigns you a distasteful task, it is the soul's call to attend to necessary, unglamorous work. Resisting her authority is to wrestle with your own highest good. Her smile is a potent blessing, signifying that your inner life is in harmony.

Chakras Inferred: Heart 🟩, Crown 🟪
Elemental Associations: Water 💧, Earth 🌍
Field Implications: Listening to the wise woman within; discerning guidance from dogma; embracing discipline as devotion.

🜁 SYMBOL: Abbot ♂️
Reinterpretation:

The Abbot represents the masculine principle of spiritual authority and the potential for its misuse. He can be a symbol of wise counsel or of treacherous plots disguised as piety. To dream of being an Abbot warns of hidden machinations against you. To see him in devotion is a caution against smooth flattery that masks deceit. His presence asks you to examine the source of authority in your life: are your guides genuine, or are they using the language of spirit to serve the ego?

🜁 SYMBOL: Abdomen 🌀
Reinterpretation:

The abdomen is the vessel of personal power and intuition—the seat of the gut feeling. To dream of it is to receive a direct message about your inner state. A healthy, whole abdomen speaks of great expectations and the vital energy to manifest them. A shriveled or empty one points to a depletion of life force, often through persecution by false friends or energies. A swollen abdomen suggests a tribulation that must be processed and birthed into wisdom. Blood from this area signifies a deep, familial wound or a traumatic severing of an energetic tie.

Chakras Inferred: Solar Plexus 🟨, Sacral 🟧

Dream Archetypes: The Alchemist, The Mother, The Wounded Healer.

🜁 SYMBOL: Abhor 🤢
Reinterpretation:

To dream of abhorrence is to confront a deep, instinctual rejection. To abhor another is your intuition sounding an alarm, validating a suspicion your conscious mind has dismissed. Trust this inner knowing. To feel abhorred by others is to recognize where your own intentions have curdled into selfishness, creating a repellent field around you. For a lover to abhor you in a dream signals a profound misalignment of spirit and values, a connection that cannot sustain itself on a soul level.

🜁 SYMBOL: Abject 🙇
Reinterpretation:

To dream of being in an abject state is to touch the floor of your current reality. It signifies a loss of personal power and a surrender to external forces. This dream brings gloomy tidings, a sign that your efforts are being undermined by a collapse in your energetic field. Seeing others in this state points to the influence of false dealings and discordant energies within your circle. The dream is a call to reclaim your sovereignty and refuse to bow to circumstances.

🜁 SYMBOL: Abode 🏡
Reinterpretation:

The Abode is the architecture of the Self. To dream you cannot find it is to lose faith in your own inner compass and your place in the world. To be without an abode is to be ungrounded, adrift in the currents of fate without an anchor. To change your abode signifies a rapid, often jarring, shift in your life's narrative. For a woman to dream of leaving her abode is a warning that the stories told about her are not her own—slander attempts to rewrite her sacred space.

Field Implications: Seeking sanctuary; grounding the self; navigating life transitions; defending personal truth.

🜁 SYMBOL: Abortion 🌿
Reinterpretation:

This is a dream of terminating potential. It signifies the contemplation of an act that will cut short the life of a burgeoning project, a relationship, or a creative endeavor. It is a warning that such an action, if undertaken, will lead to a deep sense of incompletion and energetic misalignment. For a doctor or healer to be party to this in a dream points to a deviation from their core purpose and a neglect of their sacred duty. The dream asks: what creative life force are you considering extinguishing, and are you prepared for the spiritual consequences?

Chakras Inferred: Sacral 🟧, Root 🟥
Elemental Associations: Water 💧, Earth 🌍

🜁 SYMBOL: Above 🌠
Reinterpretation:

To see an object hanging above you is to become aware of a potential, a threat, or a destiny suspended over your life path. If it feels dangerous or is about to fall, it represents an imminent crisis or a "Sword of Damocles"—a pressure you can no longer ignore. If it falls and misses you, you have narrowly averted disaster. If it is securely fixed, it symbolizes a blessing or a goal that is protected and attainable, a guiding star in your personal firmament. The dream directs your gaze upward, asking you to consider the higher forces at play in your life.

🜁 SYMBOL: Abroad ✈️
Reinterpretation:

To dream of being abroad is to step outside the familiar landscape of your mind. It signifies a journey into new states of being, new perspectives, and new energetic climates. This dream suggests a necessary departure from your current reality to find a solution or a missing piece of yourself. It is a call to expand your horizons, whether physically or spiritually, and to embrace the wisdom that comes from leaving the comforts of the known.

Chakras Inferred: Throat 🟦, Third Eye 👁️

🜁 SYMBOL: Absalom ⚔️
Reinterpretation:

Absalom is the archetype of the beloved child whose ambition and betrayal bring ruin. To dream of him is to be warned of a deep wound coming from a place of love. It can signify the painful consequences of ambition untempered by wisdom, or the heartbreak of a child's rebellion against a parent's legacy. This dream cautions against the seductive allure of pride and the destructive power of unresolved family dynamics. It asks: what beloved part of your life, or yourself, is being sacrificed for power or vanity?

Chakras Inferred: Heart 🟩, Solar Plexus 🟨
Elemental Associations: Fire 🔥, Air 💨

🜁 SYMBOL: Absence 💨
Reinterpretation:

To feel the ache of absence in a dream is to acknowledge an energetic void in your life. To grieve the absence of another is to process a necessary repentance, an emotional clearing that makes way for a stronger bond upon their return. To rejoice in an absence, however, signifies the successful dispelling of a negative influence or an enemy's power over you. The dream highlights what is missing, asking you to discern whether the void is a wound to be healed or a space to be celebrated.

Chakras Inferred: Heart 🟩, Throat 🟦
Elemental Associations: Air 💨, Ether ✨

🜁 SYMBOL: Abscess ☣️
Reinterpretation:

An abscess in a dream is a pocket of toxic, unexpressed energy that has reached a critical state. It represents a long-neglected issue—be it emotional, physical, or spiritual—that is now festering beneath the surface. The pressure is building, and a painful release is imminent. This dream warns that you are carrying a burden of misfortune or sorrow, your own or that of another, and it is beginning to poison your system. It is a powerful call to lance the wound, release the toxicity, and begin the process of deep healing.

Chakras Inferred: Root 🟥, Sacral 🟧
Elemental Associations: Water 💧 (pus), Fire 🔥 (inflammation)
Field Implications: Addressing repressed toxicity; lancing emotional wounds; recognizing festering negativity; need for purification.

🜁 SYMBOL: Absinthe 🌿
Reinterpretation:

To dream of absinthe is to dance with the "Green Fairy"—a symbol of seductive, mind-altering pleasure that blurs the lines of reality and responsibility. It points to a path of foolish indulgence, a squandering of vital energy and inheritance (whether material or spiritual) on a siren's call. For a woman to drink it with a lover is a potent warning against yielding her sovereignty and power in a relationship built on illusion rather than truth. The dream asks what intoxicating escape you are using to avoid reality, and if you are aware of the price.

Chakras Inferred: Third Eye 👁️, Sacral 🟧
Elemental Associations: Water 💧, Ether ✨
Field Implications: Recognizing escapist tendencies; warning against intoxicating illusions; assessing the cost of pleasure; potential for self-deception.

🜁 SYMBOL: Abundance 🌾
Reinterpretation:

To dream of abundance is to connect with the infinite wellspring of Universal Source. It affirms that the flow of prosperity is open to you and that lack is an illusion. However, this dream carries a profound warning: possession of material abundance without a corresponding richness of spirit leads to a collapse in the heart's domain. Infidelity to your soul's purpose or your sacred bonds will curdle the gift. True abundance is a holistic state, not just a full coffer.

Chakras Inferred: Solar Plexus 🟨, Heart 🟩
Elemental Associations: Earth 🌍, Fire 🔥

🜁 SYMBOL: Abuse 🗣️
Reinterpretation:

To dream of abuse is to witness a violation of energetic sovereignty. To be the abuser in a dream reveals a misuse of your own power, a persistence that has become toxic and is creating loss in your life. To feel abused shows where your boundaries are being crossed and your life force is being drained by the enmity of others. For a woman to hear abusive language is a warning against the poison of envy and jealousy in her environment. This dream is a stark call to examine power dynamics, both within and without, and to restore balance and respect.

🜁 SYMBOL: Abyss 🕳️
Reinterpretation:

The Abyss is the great unknown, the terrifying void that precedes creation or destruction. To stand at its edge is to confront a profound threat to your foundational security—your property, your identity, your very sense of self. It speaks of deep, personal quarrels that challenge the core of your being. For a woman to gaze into it is to feel the pull of unwelcome and overwhelming responsibilities. To fall into the abyss is to surrender to a total collapse, a dark night of the soul. To successfully cross or avoid it signifies a powerful act of self-reinstatement, a reclaiming of your power in the face of annihilation.

Chakras Inferred: Root 🟥, Third Eye 👁️
Elemental Associations: Earth 🌍, Ether ✨
Field Implications: Confronting deep fears; facing the unknown; potential for total system collapse or rebirth; navigating profound existential challenges.

🜁 SYMBOL: Academy 🏫
Reinterpretation:

The Academy represents a structured place of higher learning, but its appearance in dreams often points to a missed opportunity or knowledge that has been improperly assimilated. To visit an academy is to regret paths not taken, potentials left dormant through indifference. To believe you are an inmate suggests you are taking on knowledge without the wisdom to apply it correctly. Returning to the academy after you have "graduated" signifies that life is presenting you with a test you feel unprepared for, a lesson you thought you had already learned.

Chakras Inferred: Third Eye 👁️, Crown 🟪
Elemental Associations: Air 💨

🜁 SYMBOL: Accepted ✅
Reinterpretation:

To dream of being accepted is to receive a 'yes' from the universe. A business proposition accepted signals a breakthrough in a difficult venture. A lover's acceptance foretells a harmonious and celebrated union. This dream confirms that you are in alignment with your desires and that the path forward is clear. However, the dream carries a vital caveat: if born from waking anxiety or weakness, the message is inverted. True acceptance is a state of grace, not a desperate need, and the dream asks you to discern the difference.

Elemental Associations: Air 💨, Water 💧
Field Implications: Confirmation of alignment; successful manifestation; harmony in relationships; overcoming obstacles to union.

🜁 SYMBOL: Accident 💥
Reinterpretation:

An accident in the dreamscape is a stark warning of impending chaos or a loss of control in your waking life. It signifies a forceful, unplanned collision with fate. This dream is a directive to avoid unnecessary risks, both physical and energetic, as you are moving through a field of high volatility. If the accident befalls your livestock or investments, it suggests that your efforts to gain something for yourself will inadvertently cause a loss for a friend or ally who supports you. It is a caution against ambition that lacks awareness of its collateral impact.

Reinterpretation:

The accordion, with its breath-like expansion and contraction, symbolizes the rhythm of emotion and the creation of harmony from sadness. To hear its music is to find a way to transform grief into a more cheerful burden. For a young woman to play it suggests she will win love through a shared experience of sorrow, a bond forged in vulnerability. An accordion out of tune signifies a dissonance in a key relationship, a love that is pained by illness or trouble. It is the sound of resilience, of making music from the push and pull of life.

🜁 SYMBOL: Accounts 🧾
Reinterpretation:

To dream of accounts is to face your energetic and karmic balance sheet. To have an account presented for payment signifies a dangerous position where a debt is being called due; a compromise or settlement is urgently required. To hold accounts against others suggests that blockages and disagreements in your own flow are creating discord. For a book-keeper or anyone to be footing up accounts is to be deeply engaged in untangling troubles in business and love, seeking a balance that will bring peace and respect. The dream is a call for accountability.

🜁 SYMBOL: Accuse ☝️
Reinterpretation:

The act of accusation in a dream highlights a breakdown in trust and a projection of blame.

To be accused yourself is a warning against your own participation in sly or malicious gossip; the energy you send out is returning to you. The dream forces a confrontation with justice, scandal, and the integrity of your word.

🜁 SYMBOL: Aches 💔
Reinterpretation:

Aches in a dream are the body's way of speaking a truth the mind ignores. They symbolize a stagnation of energy or progress. A heartache reveals a delay or lagging in love's expression. A backache points to a lack of support or a burden carried too long, often due to self-neglect. A headache signifies mental turmoil, often from taking a risk against your better judgment. The dream uses the language of physical pain to alert you to a deeper, energetic malady that requires your attention.

To merely see poisonous acid is to become aware of treachery being prepared against you. This is a dream of potent, destructive energy that warns of dissolving structures, caustic words, and harmful intentions.

To pick them from the ground speaks of success earned through patient labor. To shake them from the tree denotes a rapid manifestation of your desires. A green acorn is a caution against haste, a reminder that potential needs time to mature. A decayed acorn warns of disappointment. The dream speaks of the relationship between small beginnings and mighty futures.

Reinterpretation:

An acquaintance in a dream represents a facet of yourself or your life that is familiar but not deeply integrated. A pleasant conversation suggests harmony in your business and domestic spheres. An argument points to coming humiliations. To feel ashamed of meeting one reveals a secret part of your life you fear will be exposed. The nature of the encounter reflects the harmony or discord within your social and professional networks, and the parts of yourself you show to the world.

To dream of acquittal is to be freed from a heavy burden of guilt, blame, or karmic debt. It signifies the imminent possession of something valuable—property, self-worth, or peace of mind—though not without a final struggle or challenge to your claim. To see others acquitted suggests that the goodwill and success of your friends will bring pleasure and ease to your own life. This dream marks the end of a trial and the restoration of honor.

To be one yourself signifies that you are about to become the center of a sensational event, making you vulnerable to the taunts of enemies. To see female acrobats warns that your name will be handled with malicious and slanderous agility. This dream questions the balance between bold action and reckless performance.

The Actor or Actress is the face we show the world, the persona we adopt. To see an actress in a dream points to a period of unbroken pleasure and social favor. To be an actor yourself signifies that your work, though necessary for survival, will be infused with a sense of play and creativity. To fall in love with one suggests a tendency to prioritize pleasure over toil. A dead actor, however, is a potent omen of misery overwhelming your good fortune. A wandering, penniless actor warns that your affairs are on the verge of collapse. The dream asks what role you are playing in your own life.

To see them in the Garden, particularly with the seductive serpent, signifies that foundational treachery and ill faith are at play, working to overthrow your fortune. Hearing Eve converse with the serpent is a specific warning against heeding artful, feminine persuasion that leads to ruin. The dream takes you to a crossroads of choice, innocence, and consequence.

It speaks of a reality that will not bend to your will, forcing you to find another way or to accept a hard limit.

The Adder is a venomous omen, a symbol of deceit and hidden threats, often connected to past wounds and unresolved grief. To see one strike at a dead friend who seems to breathe again signifies deep distress over the misfortunes of others, which are linked to a threat against you. It suggests old issues and relationships, thought buried, still have the power to poison the present. For a woman to see an adder warns of a deceitful person weaving trouble. For it to run from her means she has the power to defend her name against this venomous attack.

Chakras Inferred: Root 🟥, Sacral 🟧

Finding an error in your calculations is a positive sign, indicating you will discern an enemy's true intent before they can act. To use a calculator or adding machine suggests you will find a powerful ally or tool to help you navigate oppression. To fail to read the figures warns against blind speculation; you lack the necessary data to proceed.

Reinterpretation:

A baby represents new beginnings, pure potential, and profound vulnerability. A bright, clean baby signifies requited love and the warmth of true friendship. A baby walking alone is a powerful symbol of independence and the strength to rise above petty concerns. To nurse a baby, however, warns of deception from one you trust completely. A sick baby in your arms is a sign of deep sorrow of the mind. The state of the dream-baby reflects the health of your newest endeavors and your most vulnerable self.

A goring bull points to the misuse of power and resources. The dream asks you to examine your relationship with power, ambition, and primal force.

🜁 SYMBOL: Cage ⛓️
Reinterpretation:

A cage in a dream represents confinement, restriction, and the containment of wild energy. To see a cage full of birds is a paradoxical symbol of captured joy, signifying immense wealth and family, but with a hint of lost freedom. To see wild animals caged means you have successfully contained your own primal urges or triumphed over chaotic enemies. To be in the cage yourself, especially with them, warns that you are trapped by your own fears or by external circumstances, often leading to harrowing and claustrophobic situations. The dream asks what you have caged, and what has caged you.

It signifies that love may be cooling into cold formality, and your endeavors may become worrying and profitless. It is a sign of decay from within. To have it successfully treated, however, is a powerful omen of a sudden and dramatic rise from obscurity and poverty into a state of vibrant, wealthy life. The dream forces a confrontation with the most insidious and feared corruptions of the soul.

Chakras Inferred: Heart 🟩, Root 🟥

To leave a castle is to be exiled from your own power, to suffer a loss of possessions or a deep personal bond. The castle is the architecture of your sovereignty.

The cat is a creature of mystery, independence, and potent psychic energy. Its appearance is often a harbinger of ill luck unless you can drive it away or kill it, signifying a mastery over hidden, negative forces. A cat attacking you is a direct assault on your reputation by enemies. A thin, dirty cat brings bad news of an absent friend. The scream of a cat is the sound of a false friend using their words to harm you. A clean, white cat, though beautiful, warns of seemingly harmless entanglements that will lead to sorrow and loss. The cat walks the line between the seen and unseen worlds and asks you to pay attention to both.

🜁 SYMBOL: Caterpillar 🐛
Reinterpretation:

The caterpillar represents a state of nascent, unrealized potential. It is the beginning of a profound transformation, but in its current form, it is vulnerable and earthbound. To dream of a caterpillar warns that you are surrounded by low, hypocritical people who may drain your energy or deceive you. It points to embarrassing situations and potential losses in love or business because your transformative process is not yet complete. You are in a vulnerable stage of growth and must protect yourself from those who would exploit it.

Reinterpretation:

The cave is the womb of the Earth, a place of introspection, secrets, and the subconscious mind. To see a cavern yawning before you is to be faced with a journey into your deepest self, a path fraught with perplexity and adversarial aspects of your own psyche. To be inside a cave signifies a profound inner change, a retreat from the world that may estrange you from those you love. For a woman to enter a cave with a lover warns of a dangerous descent into a relationship with a shadowy figure. The cave is the threshold to your own underworld.

To dream of being bound in them signifies that the weight of external expectations or your own limiting beliefs is holding you down. To break the chains is to free yourself from an unhealthy social or business engagement. To see others in chains reflects the misfortune of those around you. Chains force you to confront what is restricting your freedom and challenge you to find the strength to break free.

🜁 SYMBOL: Circle ⭕
Reinterpretation:

The circle represents wholeness, cycles, and eternity. However, in dreams, it can also signify deceptive boundaries and repeating patterns. To dream of a circle warns that your affairs may appear whole and promising but are actually trapping you in a loop with no real gain. For a young woman, it is a caution against getting caught in social or romantic cycles that prevent true commitment and progress. The dream asks you to examine whether the circles in your life are sacred and whole, or merely empty, repeating loops.

To hear it strike signifies the arrival of unpleasant news or the death of a hope. A broken clock suggests a disruption in your life's rhythm, a feeling of being stuck or out of sync. This dream is a powerful reminder of mortality and the pressing need to act on your priorities before your own time runs out.

Stars shining through clouds point to fleeting joys and small, though meaningful, advancements. The state of the clouds reflects the state of your mental and emotional sky.

Reinterpretation:

A coffin is a symbol of profound endings, confinement, and the death of some part of your life. It is an unlucky omen, foretelling the blasting of crops (creations), illness among livestock (instincts), and deep sorrow. To see your own coffin signifies a major defeat in business or a domestic tragedy. A moving coffin suggests that sickness and a significant union (perhaps even marriage) are closely linked. To see your own corpse in the coffin reveals a feeling of utter defeat and ignominy. The coffin demands you look at what must be buried and laid to rest in your life.

A corpse in black warns of the violent death of a friend or a desperate business entanglement. A battlefield strewn with corpses signifies widespread conflict that will affect you. To see the corpse of an animal points to a loss of instinctual health. The dream forces a direct confrontation with death, decay, and the consequences of lifeless action.

To see a cross in a dream is an undeniable sign of trouble ahead, and you are being advised to prepare your spirit for a test. To see another person bearing a cross signifies that you will be called upon to help another carry their heavy load, an act of charity and sacrifice. It is the emblem of a sacred duty that cannot be avoided.

A crowd in church points to a death or significant solemn occasion. A crowd in the street indicates a time of brisk activity and opportunity. Trying to make yourself heard in a crowd signifies a struggle to assert your individuality. The dream's meaning hinges on the mood and appearance of the collective; it is a mirror of your social world.

🜁 SYMBOL: Crown 👑
Reinterpretation:

The crown is the emblem of sovereignty, mastery, and ultimate authority. To dream of wearing one signals a loss of personal property—a sacrifice is required to achieve this level of rule. To dream of a crown itself, however, signifies a major life change, travel, and the formation of new, powerful relationships. It can, in some cases, warn of a fatal illness, as the ultimate coronation is death. To crown another is to recognize and affirm your own highest worth. The dream speaks to your relationship with power, leadership, and destiny.

D
🜁 SYMBOL: Dagger 🗡️
Reinterpretation:

The dagger is a symbol of close-range betrayal, piercing words, and sudden, intimate violence. Its appearance is a warning of threatening enemies who are already within your personal space. To wrench a dagger from another's hand signifies your ability to disarm a foe and counteract their influence. To be stabbed by one suggests a deep, personal wound is coming. Unlike a sword, which speaks of open battle, the dagger represents the hidden threat, the secret plot, and the words that cut to the quick.

To lose a friend or child in the darkness warns that you are being provoked to anger and must maintain control.

To speak with a dead father indicates a looming unlucky transaction; enemies are near. To see a dead mother warns you to control your morbid or resentful inclinations. To see a dead friend or sibling suggests a call for your help is coming. If the dead appear living and happy, it warns you are allowing negative influences into your life.

Death in a dream rarely signifies a physical end. Instead, it represents a profound transformation, the end of one state of being to make way for another. To dream of your people dying warns of dissolution and sorrow; your old world is falling away. To hear that a friend is dead signifies bad news is on the way. Often, dreaming of a death is a symbolic representation of a part of yourself that must die—a bad habit, a limiting belief, an unhealthy attachment. It is the end of a chapter. The dream asks you to let go and surrender to the transformative process.

The desert is the landscape of the soul stripped bare. It represents a period of spiritual famine, trial, and purification. To wander through a desert is to face great loss, isolation, and a test of your endurance. For a woman to be alone in the desert is a warning that her vitality and reputation are at risk; she must be more cautious with her life force. The desert is the realm of the hermit and the prophet, a place where one must face the self without distraction. It is a harsh but potentially transformative environment.

🜁 SYMBOL: Devil 😈
Reinterpretation:

The Devil in a dream is the ultimate tempter, the personalized face of your own shadow and deepest fears. He represents the allure of power, flattery, and sensual indulgence that leads to ruin. To be pursued by him is to fall into snares set by hidden enemies or your own self-destructive impulses. To see him as a large, well-dressed man signifies that ruin is approaching you disguised as sophisticated flattery. Women are warned against the attentions of such figures. To defeat the Devil is to reclaim your power from the shadow and commit to a higher path. He is a forerunner of despair, but also a catalyst for profound self-control.

For a woman to receive them from a lover promises a great and honorable marriage. However, to lose a diamond is one of the most unlucky signs, foretelling disgrace, want, and death of a hope. Their brilliance represents the highest potential of the soul, but their loss signifies a profound fall from grace.

Dirt represents the foundational, primal earth, but also social impurity and contamination. To see freshly stirred dirt around plants is a sign of health and thrift. To have your clothes soiled with dirt signifies that you are at risk from contagious energies and must cleanse yourself or your environment. For someone to throw dirt on you is a direct psychic attack on your reputation. The dream asks you to examine the "dirt" in your life—is it fertile ground for growth, or is it a stain on your honor?

To be rescued, however, indicates that you will rise from this crisis to a place of greater wealth and honor. To rescue another from drowning shows that you will be instrumental in a friend's success, which will in turn bring you happiness. For a young woman to see her lover drown suggests a true and final bereavement. Drowning is the ultimate surrender to the watery depths of the unconscious.

The eagle is a message from the highest realms of your own potential.

An eclipse is the temporary occultation of a major celestial light, signifying a period of darkness and confusion in a specific area of your life. An eclipse of the sun—the masculine, conscious principle—points to temporary failures in business and public life, and disturbances in the outer world. An eclipse of the moon—the feminine, unconscious principle—warns of contagion, emotional distress, and sickness that comes from the unseen realms. Both are omens that a vital source of energy will be temporarily blocked.

The forest is a place of testing, but also of great, untamed potential.

An emaciated or dead Mother, however, warns of a deep sadness caused by dishonor or a severing from this life-giving principle. To hear her call is the voice of your own conscience, noting where you have gone astray from your duties. Her cry of pain is a true omen of affliction, for when the source is wounded, all of creation feels it.

To lose an oar is to lose the ability to direct your course, leading to vain efforts. A broken oar signifies an interruption in an anticipated pleasure. The dream asks you to consider who is doing the rowing in your life and if you are in control of your own direction.

_Pig_.[158]


To dream of a fat, healthy pig, denotes reasonable success in affairs.
If they are wallowing in mire, you will have hurtful associates,
and your engagements will be subject to reproach. This dream will bring
to a young woman a jealous and greedy companion though the chances
are that he will be wealthy.



[158] See Hog.


_Pigeon_.


To dream of seeing pigeons and hearing them cooing above their cotes,
denotes domestic peace and pleasure-giving children. For a young woman,
this dream indicates an early and comfortable union.


To see them being used in a shooting match, and, if you participate,
it denotes that cruelty in your nature will show in your dealings,
and you are warned of low and debasing pleasures.


To see them flying, denotes freedom from misunderstanding,
and perhaps news from the absent.


_Pilgrim_.


To dream of pilgrims, denotes that you will go on an extended journey,
leaving home and its dearest objects in the mistaken idea that it must
be thus for their good.


To dream that you are a pilgrim, portends struggles with poverty
and unsympathetic companions.


For a young woman to dream that a pilgrim approaches her,
she will fall an easy dupe to deceit. If he leaves her,
she will awaken to her weakness of character and strive
to strengthen independent thought.

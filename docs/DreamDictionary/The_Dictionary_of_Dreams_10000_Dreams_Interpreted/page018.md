with existing formalities. Then, why not study more seriously the mental
images reflected from the mirror of the soul upon our minds through the occult
processes within us?


Thirdly, the spiritual dreams are brought about by the higher self penetrating
the soul realm, and reflecting upon the waking mind approaching events.
When we put our animal mind and soul in harmony with our higher self we
become one with it, and, therefore, one with the universal mind or will by
becoming a part of it. It is through the higher self we reach the infinite.
It is through the lower self we fall into the whirlpool of matter.


These dreams are a part of the universal mind until they
transpire in the life of man. After this they go to make a part
of the personal soul. Whatever has not taken place in the mind,
or life of man, belongs exclusively to the impersonal mind.
But as soon as a man lives or sees a thing, that thing
instantly becomes a part of his soul; hence, the clairvoyant,

as the future belongs exclusively to God or the universal mind,
and has no material, subjective existence; therefore, it cannot
be known except through the channels of the higher self,
which is the Truth or the Word that is constantly striving
to manifest itself through the flesh.


Our psychical research people give us conclusive proof of mental
telepathy or telegraphy between finite minds. Thus communications
or impressions are conveyed many miles from one mind to another.
This phenomenon is easier when one or both of the subjects are
in a state of somnambulence or asleep.


In thought transference or mind reading it is absolutely
necessary to have a positive and a negative subject.
Through the same law that mental impressions are telegraphed
from one finite mind to another a man may place himself in harmony
with the infinite mind and thus receive true and healthful
warnings of coming evil or good. Homer, Aristotle and other
writers of the ancient classics thought this not improbable.


The statesman, the poet, the philosopher of the Bible were
unanimous in attaching prophetic significance to dreams.
Has the law of ethereal vibrations undergone any recent
changes to debar or molest the communion of the soul with its

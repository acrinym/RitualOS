_Husband_.


To dream that your husband is leaving you, and you do not understand why,
there will be bitterness between you, but an unexpected reconciliation
will ensue. If he mistreats and upbraids you for unfaithfulness,
you will hold his regard and confidence, but other worries will ensue
and you are warned to be more discreet in receiving attention from men.


If you see him dead, disappointment and sorrow will envelop you.


To see him pale and careworn, sickness will tax you heavily,
as some of the family will linger in bed for a time.


To see him gay and handsome, your home will be filled with
happiness and bright prospects will be yours. If he is sick,
you will be mistreated by him and he will be unfaithful.


To dream that he is in love with another woman, he will soon tire
of his present surroundings and seek pleasure elsewhere.


To be in love with another woman's husband in your dreams,
denotes that you are not happily married, or that you are not
happy unmarried, but the chances for happiness are doubtful.


For an unmarried woman to dream that she has a husband, denotes that she
is wanting in the graces which men most admire.


To see your husband depart from you, and as he recedes from you he grows
larger, inharmonious surroundings will prevent immediate congeniality.
If disagreeable conclusions are avoided, harmony will be reinstated.


For a woman to dream she sees her husband in a compromising
position with an unsuspected party, denotes she will have trouble
through the indiscretion of friends. If she dreams that he is
killed while with another woman, and a scandal ensues, she will
be in danger of separating from her husband or losing property.
Unfavorable conditions follow this dream, though the evil
is often exaggerated.


_Hut_.


To dream of a hut, denotes indifferent success.

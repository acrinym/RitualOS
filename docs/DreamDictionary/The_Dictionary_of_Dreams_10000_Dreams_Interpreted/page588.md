``_The Prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream_.''--Jer. XXIII., 28.


_Yacht_.


To see a yacht in a dream, denotes happy recreation away
from business and troublesome encumbrances. A stranded one,
represents miscarriage of entertaining engagements.


_Yankee_.


To dream of a Yankee, foretells that you will remain loyal
and true to your promise and duty, but if you are not careful
you will be outwitted in some transaction.


_Yard Stick_.


To dream of a yard stick, foretells much anxiety will possess you,
though your affairs assume unusual activity.


_Yarn_.


To dream of yarn, denotes success in your business and an industrious
companion in your home.


For a young woman to dream that she works with yarn, foretells that she
will be proudly recognized by a worthy man as his wife.


_Yawning_.


If you yawn in your dreams, you will search in vain for
health and contentment.


To see others yawning, foretells that you will see some of your friends
in a miserable state. Sickness will prevent them from their usual labors.

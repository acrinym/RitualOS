To dream that you attempt to close a door, and it falls from
its hinges, injuring some one, denotes that malignant evil
threatens your friend through your unintentionally wrong advice.
If you see another attempt to lock a door, and it falls from
its hinges, you will have knowledge of some friend's misfortune
and be powerless to aid him.


_Door Bell_.


To dream you hear or ring a door bell, foretells unexpected tidings,
or a hasty summons to business, or the bedtide of a sick relative.


_Doves_.


Dreaming of doves mating and building their nests, indicates peacefulness
of the world and joyous homes where children render obedience, and mercy
is extended to all.


To hear the lonely, mournful voice of a dove, portends sorrow and
disappointment through the death of one to whom you looked for aid.
Often it portends the death of a father.


To see a dead dove, is ominous of a separation of husband and wife,
either through death or infidelity.


To see white doves, denotes bountiful harvests and the utmost
confidence in the loyalty of friends.


To dream of seeing a flock of white doves, denotes peaceful,
innocent pleasures, and fortunate developments in the future.


If one brings you a letter, tidings of a pleasant nature from absent
friends is intimated, also a lovers' reconciliation is denoted.


If the dove seems exhausted, a note of sadness will pervade
the reconciliation, or a sad touch may be given the pleasant tidings
by mention of an invalid friend; if of business, a slight drop may follow.
If the letter bears the message that you are doomed, it foretells
that a desperate illness, either your own or of a relative,
may cause you financial misfortune.

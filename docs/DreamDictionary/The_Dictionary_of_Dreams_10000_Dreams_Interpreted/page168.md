_Custard_.[48]


For a married woman to dream of making or eating custard,
indicates she will be called upon to entertain an unexpected guest.
A young woman will meet a stranger who will in time become a warm friend.
If the custard has a sickening sweet taste, or is insipid, nothing but
sorrow will intervene where you had expected a pleasant experience.



[48] See Baking.


_Custom-house_.


To dream of a custom-house, denotes you will have rivalries and competition
in your labors.


To enter a custom-house, foretells that you will strive for,
or have offered you, a position which you have long desired.


To leave one, signifies loss of position, trade or failure of securing
some desired object.


_Cut_.


To dream of a cut, denotes sickness or the treachery of a friend
will frustrate your cheerfulness.


_Cymbal_.


Hearing a cymbal in your dreams, foretells the death of a very aged
person of your acquaintance. The sun will shine, but you will see
it darkly because of gloom.

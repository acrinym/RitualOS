_Called_.


To hear your name called in a dream by strange voices,
denotes that your business will fall into a precarious state,
and that strangers may lend you assistance, or you may fail
to meet your obligations.


To hear the voice of a friend or relative, denotes the desperate
illness of some one of them, and may be death; in the latter
case you may be called upon to stand as guardian over some one,
in governing whom you should use much discretion.


Lovers hearing the voice of their affianced should heed the warning.
If they have been negligent in attention they should make amends.
Otherwise they may suffer separation from misunderstanding.


To hear the voice of the dead may be a warning of your own serious
illness or some business worry from bad judgment may ensue.
The voice is an echo thrown back from the future on the subjective mind,
taking the sound of your ancestor's voice from coming in contact
with that part of your ancestor which remains with you.
A certain portion of mind matter remains the same in lines
of family descent.


_Calendar_.


To dream of keeping a calendar, indicates that you will be very orderly
and systematic in habits throughout the year.


To see a calendar, denotes disappointment in your calculations.


_Calm_.


To see calm seas, denotes successful ending of doubtful undertaking.


To feel calm and happy, is a sign of a long and well-spent life
and a vigorous old age.

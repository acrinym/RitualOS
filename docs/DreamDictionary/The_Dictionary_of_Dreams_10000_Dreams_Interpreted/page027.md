Evil or righteous acts recently committed will more acutely affect
the present waking mind than those enacted at a more remote period.
In a similar way future disaster or success which is soon to occur
will impress the dream mind more vividly than those which are
to transpire at a later date. But in the lives of all men there
are past incidents which they will never forget, and which
will never cease to fill their hearts with pride or remorse.
So, too, in their distant future there are important events
to transpire which are struggling through tumultuous infinitude
to leave their ghastly or smiling impress upon the dream mind.
If your mental states are passive you will receive the warnings.
There are cases on record which show events have been forecast
years ahead of their occurrence.


We do not claim that this book will prove an interpreter of all dreams,
or that the keys disclosed will open to you all the mysteries of the future,
or even all those surrounding your own personality, but by studying

and considered as such. They cannot be analyzed in detail or as a whole.
In mathematics we have nine digits from which an infinite variety
of combinations may be formed and solved by the deduction of the mind.
Through them we may measure time, space, quality and quantity.


The symbol o and I exist by reason of _no thing_ and _some
thing_ or death and life. The figure one is subject to
illimitable expansion. It is without beginning in the infinite
of number, as God is without beginning in the infinite of being.
As with the vegetable kingdom, the tiny seed or acorn silently
working its magical transformation into a plant or tree,
and directing its destiny with marvelous intelligence
through the torrid and frigid vicissitudes of the seasons;
so is man without beginning in the infinitude of his own
being or microcosm. Man is both a type and antitype.
A type of what pre-existed in the imagination of the world, and an
antitype of a future life yet to manifest itself on another plane
where the incidents of the one will be subjective, as the events
occurring in infancy or in other planes are now subjective.
His dreams, thoughts and actions, and the influences that
produce them and their multiplying combination, cannot be

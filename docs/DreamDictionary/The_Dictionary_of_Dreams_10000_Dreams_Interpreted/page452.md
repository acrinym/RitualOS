_Refrigerator_.


To see a refrigerator in your dreams, portends that your selfishness will
offend and injure some one who endeavors to gain an honest livelihood.


To put ice in one, brings the dreamer into disfavor.


_Register_.


To dream that some one registers your name at a hotel for you,
denotes you will undertake some work which will be finished by others.


If you register under an assumed name, you will engage in some guilty
enterprise which will give you much uneasiness of mind.


_Reindeer_.


To dream of a reindeer, signifies faithful discharge of duties,
and remaining staunch to friends in their adversity.


To drive them, foretells that you will have hours of bitter anguish,
but friends will attend you.


_Religion_.


If you dream of discussing religion and feel religiously inclined,
you will find much to mar the calmness of your life, and business
will turn a disagreeable front to you.


If a young woman imagines that she is over religious, she will disgust
her lover with her efforts to act ingenuous innocence and goodness.


If she is irreligious and not a transgressor, it foretells that she will have
that independent frankness and kind consideration for others, which wins
for women profound respect, and love from the opposite sex as well as her own;
but if she is a transgressor in the eyes of religion, she will find that there
are moral laws, which, if disregarded, will place her outside the pale
of honest recognition. She should look well after her conduct. If she
weeps over religion, she will be disappointed in the desires of her heart.
If she is defiant, but innocent of offence, she will shoulder burdens bravely,
and stand firm against deceitful admonitions.

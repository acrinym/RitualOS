to your selfishness.


To destroy whisky, you will lose your friends by your ungenerous conduct.


Whisky is not fraught with much good. Disappointment in some form
will likely appear.

many disappointments. If you only see it, you will never obtain
the result hoped and worked for.

gossiping of people near you.


To hear a whisper coming to you as advice or warning, foretells that you
stand in need of aid and counsel.


_Whistle_.


To hear a whistle in your dream, denotes that you will be shocked by some
sad intelligence, which will change your plans laid for innocent pleasure.


To dream that you are whistling, foretells a merry occasion in which you
expect to figure largely. This dream for a young woman indicates indiscreet
conduct and failure to obtain wishes is foretold.


_White Lead_.

because of your carelessness. Prosperity will be chary of favor.

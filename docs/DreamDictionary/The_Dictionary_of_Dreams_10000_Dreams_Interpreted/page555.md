_Vicar_.


To dream of a vicar, foretells that you will do foolish things
while furious with jealousy and envy.


For a young woman to dream she marries a vicar, foretells that she
will fail to awake reciprocal affection in the man she desires,
and will live a spinster, or marry to keep from being one.


_Vice_.


To dream that you are favoring any vice, signifies you are about to endanger
your reputation, by letting evil persuasions entice you.


If you see others indulging in vice, some ill fortune will engulf
the interest of some relative or associate.


_Victim_.


To dream that you are the victim of any scheme, foretells that
you will be oppressed and over-powered by your enemies.
Your family relations will also be strained.


To victimize others, denotes that you will amass wealth dishonorably
and prefer illicit relations, to the sorrow of your companions.


_Victory_.


To dream that you win a victory, foretells that you will successfully resist
the attacks of enemies, and will have the love of women for the asking.


_Village_.


To dream that you are in a village, denotes that you will enjoy
good health and find yourself fortunately provided for.


To revisit the village home of your youth, denotes that you will have pleasant
surprises in store and favorable news from absent friends.


If the village looks dilapidated, or the dream indistinct,
it foretells that trouble and sadness will soon come to you.

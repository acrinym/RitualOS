a dangerous embankment, portends that she will be driven
into an illicit entanglement, which will fill her with terror,

bringing opprobrium upon herself.


A broken wagon represents distress and failure.


_Wagtail_.


To see a wagtail in a dream, foretells that you will be the victim
of unpleasant gossip, and your affairs will develop unmistakable loss.

A wail falling upon your ear while in the midst of a dream,
brings fearful news of disaster and woe.


For a young woman to hear a wail, foretells that she will be deserted
and left alone in distress, and perchance disgrace.

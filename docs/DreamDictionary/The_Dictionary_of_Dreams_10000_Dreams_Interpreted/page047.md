_Actor and Actress_.


To see in your dreams an actress, denotes that your present state
will be one of unbroken pleasure and favor.


To see one in distress, you will gladly contribute your means and influence
to raise a friend from misfortune and indebtedness.


If you think yourself one, you will have to work for subsistence,
but your labors will be pleasantly attended.


If you dream of being in love with one, your inclination and talent
will be allied with pleasure and opposed to downright toil.


To see a dead actor, or actress, your good luck will be overwhelmed
in violent and insubordinate misery.


To see them wandering and penniless, foretells that your affairs
will undergo a change from promise to threatenings of failure.
To those enjoying domestic comforts, it is a warning of revolution
and faithless vows.


For a young woman to dream that she is engaged to an actor,
or about to marry one, foretells that her fancy will bring
remorse after the glamor of pleasure has vanished.


If a man dreams that he is sporting with an actress,
it foretells that private broils with his wife, or sweetheart,
will make him more misery than enjoyment.


_Adam and Eve_.


To dream of Adam and Eve, foretells that some eventful occasion
will rob you of the hope of success in your affairs.


To see them in the garden, Adam dressed in his fig leaf, but Eve perfectly
nude save for an Oriental colored serpent ornamenting her waist and abdomen,
signifies that treachery and ill faith will combine to overthrow your fortune.


To see or hear Eve conversing with the serpent, foretells that artful
women will reduce you to the loss of fortune and reputation.

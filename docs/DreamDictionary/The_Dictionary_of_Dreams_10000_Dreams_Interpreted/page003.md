Barabbas, the robber, was set at liberty.


The ultimatum of all human decrees and wisdom is to gratify
the passions of the flesh at the expense of the spirit.
The prophets and those who have stood nearest the fountain
of universal knowledge used dreams with more frequency than
any other mode of divination.


Profane, as well as sacred, history is threaded with incidents
of dream prophecy. Ancient history relates that Gennadius
was convinced of the immortality of his soul by conversing
with an apparition in his dream.


Through the dream of Cecilia Metella, the wife of a Consul, the Roman Senate
was induced to order the temple of Juno Sospita rebuilt.


The Emperor Marcian dreamed he saw the bow of the Hunnish conqueror
break on the same night that Attila died.


Plutarch relates how Augustus, while ill, through the dream
of a friend, was persuaded to leave his tent, which a few hours
after was captured by the enemy, and the bed whereon he had lain
was pierced with the enemies' swords.


If Julius Caesar had been less incredulous about dreams he would
have listened to the warning which Calpurnia, his wife,
received in a dream.


Croesus saw his son killed in a dream.


Petrarch saw his beloved Laura, in a dream, on the day she died,
after which he wrote his beautiful poem, ``The Triumph of Death.''


Cicero relates the story of two traveling Arcadians who went to
different lodgings--one to an inn, and the other to a private house.
During the night the latter dreamed that his friend was begging for help.
The dreamer awoke; but, thinking the matter unworthy of notice, went to
sleep again. The second time he dreamed his friend appeared, saying it would
be too late, for he had already been murdered and his body hid in a cart,
under manure. The cart was afterward sought for and the body found.
Cicero also wrote, ``If the gods love men they will certainly disclose
their purposes to them in sleep.''

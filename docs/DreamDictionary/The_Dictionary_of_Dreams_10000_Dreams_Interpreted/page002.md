Ten Thousand Dreams Interpreted



BY
GUSTAVUS HINDMAN MILLER



``In a dream, in a vision of the night, when
deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon
the bed; then he openeth the ears of men and
sealeth their instruction that he may withdraw
man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.''
--Job xxxiii., 15.




PREFACE.



``Dreams are rudiments of the great state to come.
We dream what is about to happen.''--BAILEY,



The Bible, as well as other great books of historical and
revealed religion, shows traces of a general and substantial
belief in dreams. Plato, Goethe, Shakespeare and Napoleon
assigned to certain dreams prophetic value. Joseph saw
eleven stars of the Zodiac bow to himself, the twelfth star.
The famine of Egypt was revealed by a vision of fat and lean cattle.
The parents of Christ were warned of the cruel edict of Herod,
and fled with the Divine Child into Egypt.


Pilate's wife, through the influence of a dream, advised her husband
to have nothing to do with the conviction of Christ. But the gross
materialism of the day laughed at dreams, as it echoed the voice and
verdict of the multitude, ``Crucify the Spirit, but let the flesh live.''

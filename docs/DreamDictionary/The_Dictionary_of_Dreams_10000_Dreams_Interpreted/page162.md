into the possession of the secrets of others, and will therefore
be in danger, for they will fear that you will betray them,
and consequently will seek your removal.


_Crippled_.


To dream of the maimed and crippled, denotes famine and distress among
the poor, and you should be willing to contribute to their store.
It also indicates a temporary dulness in trade.


_Crochet Work_.


To dream of doing crochet work, foretells your entanglement in some silly
affair growing out of a too great curiosity about other people's business.
Beware of talking too frankly with over-confidential women.


_Crockery_.


To dream of having an abundance of nice, clean crockery,
denotes that you will be a tidy and economical housekeeper.


To be in a crockery store, indicates, if you are a merchant
or business man, that you will look well to the details of your
business and thereby experience profit. To a young woman,
this dream denotes that she will marry a sturdy and upright man.
An untidy store, with empty shelves, implies loss.


_Crocodile_.


As sure as you dream of this creature, you will be deceived by your
warmest friends. Enemies will assail you at every turn.


To dream of stepping on a crocodile's back, you may expect to fall into
trouble, from which you will have to struggle mightily to extricate yourself.
Heed this warning when dreams of this nature visit you. Avoid giving your
confidence even to friends.


_Cross_.


To dream of seeing a cross, indicates trouble ahead for you.
Shape your affairs accordingly.

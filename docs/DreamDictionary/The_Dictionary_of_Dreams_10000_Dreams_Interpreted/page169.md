_Dagger_.


If seen in a dream, denotes threatening enemies. If you wrench the dagger
from the hand of another, it denotes that you will be able to counteract
the influence of your enemies and overcome misfortune.

signifies good fortune to the dreamer.

Dairy is a good dream both to the married and unmarried.


[50] See Churning Butter.


_Daisy_.


To dream of a bunch of daisys, implies sadness, but if you dream
of being in a field where these lovely flowers are in bloom,
with the sun shining and birds singing, happiness, health and
prosperity will vie each with the other to lead you through
the pleasantest avenues of life.


To dream of seeing them out of season, you will be assailed by evil
in some guise.


_Damask Rose_.


To dream of seeing a damask rosebush in full foliage and bloom,
denotes that a wedding will soon take place in your family,
and great hopes will be fulfilled.


For a lover to place this rose in your hair, foretells that you will
be deceived. If a woman receives a bouquet of damask roses in springtime,
she will have a faithful lover; but if she received them in winter,
she will cherish blasted hopes.

in some desire that you held as your life.


_Adder_.


To dream of seeing an adder strike, and a friend, who is dead but seems
to be lying down and breathing, rises partly to a sitting position when
the adder strikes at him, and then both disappearing into some bushes nearby,
denotes that you will be greatly distressed over the ill luck of friends,
and a loss threatened to yourself.


For a young woman to see an adder, foretells a deceitful
person is going to cause her trouble. If it runs from her,
she will be able to defend her character in attacks made on her.


_Addition_.


To dream of pondering over addition, denotes that you will have a struggle
to overcome difficult situations, which will soon prominently assume
formidable shapes in your business transactions.

before they have executed their design.

_Adieu_.


To dream of bidding cheerful adieus to people, denotes that you
will make pleasant visits and enjoy much social festivity;
but if they are made in a sad or doleful strain, you will endure
loss and bereaving sorrow.


If you bid adieu to home and country, you will travel in the nature
of an exile from fortune and love.

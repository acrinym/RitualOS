in the depth of the earth, away from atmospheric changes,
knows of the approach of the harvest, and comes forth to lay
by his store.


In a like manner, the pet squirrel is a better barometer of the local weather
than the Weather Bureau. With unerring foresight, when a wintry frown nowhere
mars the horizon, he is able to apprehend a cold wave twenty-four hours ahead,
and build his house accordingly.


So in sleep, man dreams the future by intuitive perception of invisible
signs or influences, while awake he reasons it out by cause and effect.
The former seems to be the law of the spiritual world, while the latter
would appear to be the law of the material world. Man should not depend
alone upon either. Together they proclaim the male and female principle
of existence and should find harmonious consummation.


In this manner only can man hope to achieve that perfect normal
state to which the best thought of the human race is aspiring,
where he can create and control influences instead of being
created and controlled by them, as the majority of us are at
the present day.


God, the highest subjective source of intelligence, may in a
dream leave impressions or presentiments on the mind of man,
the highest objective source of intelligence.


The physical sun sends its light into the dark corners of the earth,
and God, the Spiritual Sun, imparts spiritual light into the passive
and receptive soul.


Man, by hiding in a cave, or closing the windows and doors of his house,
may shut out all physical light; so he may steep his soul in sensual
debauchery until all spiritual light is shut out.


Just as the vital essence of the soil, the mother of nature,
may be extracted by abuse, either from omission or commission,
until neither the light of the sun, nor the moisture of the heavens
will wake the flush of life, so may the spiritual essence
be deadened when the soil of the soul is filled with the aged
and multiplying weeds of ravishing materiality.


The dream mind is often influenced by the waking mind.

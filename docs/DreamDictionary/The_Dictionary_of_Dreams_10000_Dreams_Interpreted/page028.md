numbered or reproduced any more than you can number the leaves
of the forest, or find two exactly similar units among them.
Thus the full meaning or interpretation of dreams cannot be fully
demonstrated through mental or even spiritual stereotypes.
But by the intelligent use of this book you will be able to trace
out almost any dream combination and arrive at the true nature
of its portent.


A wise doctor, in preparing medicine for a patient,
considers well his age, temperament and his present condition.
So should the interpreter of dreams ponder well the mental state,
the health, habits and temperament of the dreamer.
These things no one can know so well as the dreamer himself.
He, therefore, with the aid of this book, will be able to interpret
his dreams by the light that is in him.


Man is the microcosm or a miniature world. He has a soul and
mental firmament, bounded by the stellar dust and the milky way,
and filled with the mystery of suns, satellites and stars.

He has also a physical plane, diversified by oceans,
lakes, rivers, fertile valleys, waste places and mountains.
All are in cosmic interdependency as they are in the macrocosm.

The two planes are dependent upon each other. It is the smile
or disease of the firmament that blesses or diseases the earth.
It is likewise the impure firmament of the microcosm that diseases
the body and soul. If it reflects the drought of thought or the
various states of evil, deserts will enlarge, forest of infectious,
venomous growth will form the habitation of lust and murder.
Before great moral or physical revolutions or catastrophes occur,
clouds will darken the horizon of the dream mind; storms will gather,
lurid flames of lightning will flash their volatile anger;
the explosive thunder will recklessly carry on its bombardment;
bells will ring, strange knocking will be heard--symbols of a message--
phantom forms will be seen, familiar voices will call and plead
with you, unknown visitors will threaten you, unearthly struggles
with hideous giants and agonies of mind and body will possess you;

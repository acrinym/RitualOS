_Chrysanthemum_.


To dream that you gather white chrysanthemums, signifies loss
and much perplexity; colored ones, betokens pleasant engagements.


To see them in bouquets, denotes that love will be offered you,
but a foolish ambition will cause you to put it aside. To pass down
an avenue of white chrysanthemums, with here and there a yellow one
showing among the white, foretells a strange sense of loss and sadness,
from which the sensibilities will expand and take on new powers.
While looking on these white flowers as you pass, and you suddenly feel
your spirit leave your body and a voice shouts aloud ``Glory to God,
my Creator,'' foretells that a crisis is pending in your near future.
If some of your friends pass out, and others take up true ideas in connection
with spiritual and earthly needs, you will enjoy life in its deepest meaning.
Often death is near you in these dreams.


_Church_.[36]


To dream of seeing a church in the distance, denotes disappointment
in pleasures long anticipated.


To enter one wrapt in gloom, you will participate in a funeral.
Dull prospects of better times are portended.


_Churchyard_.


To dream of walking in a churchyard, if in winter, denotes that you are
to have a long and bitter struggle with poverty, and you will reside far
from the home of your childhood, and friends will be separated from you;
but if you see the signs of springtime, you will walk up in into pleasant
places and enjoy the society of friends.


For lovers to dream of being in a churchyard means they will never marry
each other, but will see others fill their places.


_Churning_.


To dream of churning, you will have difficult tasks set you, but by
diligence and industry you will accomplish them and be very prosperous.
To the farmer, it denotes profit from a plenteous harvest; to a young woman,
it denotes a thrifty and energetic husband.

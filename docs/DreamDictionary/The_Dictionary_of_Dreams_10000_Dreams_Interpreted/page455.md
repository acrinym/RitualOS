have heavy losses, but will eventually regain more than you lose,
and happiness will attend you.


To resuscitate another, you will form new friendships, which will give
you prominence and pleasure.


_Revelation_.


To dream of a revelation, if it be of a pleasant nature,
you may expect a bright outlook, either in business or love;

features to overcome.


_Revenge_.


To dream of taking revenge, is a sign of a weak and uncharitable nature,

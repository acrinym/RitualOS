If God speaks to you, beware that you do not fall into condemnation.
Business of all sorts will take an unfavorable turn. It is the forerunner
of the weakening of health and may mean early dissolution.


If you dream of worshiping God, you will have cause to repent
of an error of your own making. Look well to observing the ten
commandments after this dream.


To dream that God confers distinct favors upon you, you will become
the favorite of a cautious and prominent person who will use his
position to advance yours.


To dream that God sends his spirit upon you, great changes in your
beliefs will take place. Views concerning dogmatic Christianity
should broaden after this dream, or you may be severely chastised
for some indiscreet action which has brought shame upon you.
God speaks oftener to those who transgress than those who do not.
It is the genius of spiritual law or economy to reinstate the prodigal
child by signs and visions. Elijah, Jonah, David, and Paul were
brought to the altar of repentence through the vigilant energy
of the hidden forces within.


_Goggles_.


To dream of goggles, is a warning of disreputable companions
who will wheedle you into lending your money foolishly.


For a young woman to dream of goggles, means that she will listen
to persuasion which will mar her fortune.


_Gold_.


If you handle gold in your dream, you will be unusually successful in
all enterprises. For a woman to dream that she receives presents of gold,
either money or ornaments, she will marry a wealthy but mercenary man.


To find gold, indicates that your superior abilities will place
you easily ahead in the race for honors and wealth.


If you lose gold, you will miss the grandest opportunity of your
life through negligence.

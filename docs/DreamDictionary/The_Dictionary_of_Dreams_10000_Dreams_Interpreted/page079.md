_Bathroom_.


To see white roses in a bathroom, and yellow ones in a box,
denote that sickness will interfere with pleasure; but more
lasting joys will result from this disappointment.


For a young woman to dream of a bathroom, foretells that her inclinations
trend too much toward light pleasures and frivolities.


_Bats_.


Awful is the fate of the unfortunate dreamer of this ugly animal.
Sorrows and calamities from hosts of evil work against you.
Death of parents and friends, loss of limbs or sight,
may follow after a dream of these ghoulish monsters.
A white bat is almost a sure sign of death. Often the death
of a child follows this dream.


_Battle_.


Battle signifies striving with difficulties, but a final victory
over the same.


If you are defeated in battle, it denotes that bad deals made
by others will mar your prospects for good.


_Bayonet_.


To dream of a bayonet, signifies that enemies will hold you in their power,
unless you get possession of the bayonet.


_Bay Tree_.


A palmy leisure awaits you in which you will meet many pleasing varieties
of diversions. Much knowledge will be reaped in the rest from work.
It is generally a good dream for everybody.


_Beacon-light_.


For a sailor to see a beacon-light, portends fair seas and
a prosperous voyage.

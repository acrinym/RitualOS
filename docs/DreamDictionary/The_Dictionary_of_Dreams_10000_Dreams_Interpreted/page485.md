_Shoemaker_.


To see a shoemaker in your dream, warns you that indications are
unfavorable to your advancement. For a woman to dream that her
husband or lover is a shoemaker, foretells competency will be hers;
her wishes will be gratified.


_Shoes_.


To dream of seeing your shoes ragged and soiled, denotes that you
will make enemies by your unfeeling criticisms.


To have them blacked in your dreams, foretells improvement in your affairs,
and some important event will cause you satisfaction.


New shoes, augur changes which will prove beneficial.
If they pinch your feet, you will be uncomfortably exposed
to the practical joking of the fun-loving companions of your sex.


To find them untied, denotes losses, quarrels and ill-health.



To lose them, is a sign of desertion and divorces.


To dream that your shoes have been stolen during the night,
but you have two pairs of hose, denotes you will have a loss,
but will gain in some other pursuit.


For a young woman to dream that her shoes are admired while on her feet,
warns her to be cautious in allowing newly introduced people, and men
of any kind, to approach her in a familiar way.


_Shooting_.[204]


To dream that you see or hear shooting, signifies unhappiness between
married couples and sweethearts because of over-weaning selfishness,
also unsatisfactory business and tasks because of negligence.

To meet an acquaintance, and converse pleasantly with him,
foretells that your business will run smoothly, and there
will be but little discord in your domestic affairs.


If you seem to be disputing, or engaged in loud talk, humiliations and
embarrassments will whirl seethingly around you.


If you feel ashamed of meeting an acquaintance, or meet him
at an inopportune time, it denotes that you will be guilty
of illicitly conducting yourself, and other parties will let
the secret out.


For a young woman to think that she has an extensive acquaintance,
signifies that she will be the possessor of vast interests, and her love
will be worthy the winning. If her circle of acquaintances is small,
she will be unlucky in gaining social favors.


[9] After dreaming of acquaintances, you may see or hear from them.


_Acquit_.


To dream that you are acquitted of a crime, denotes that you
are about to come into possession of valuable property,
but there is danger of a law suit before obtaining possession.


To see others acquitted, foretells that your friends will add
pleasure to your labors.


_Acrobat_.


To dream of seeing acrobats, denotes that you will be prevented from carrying
out hazardous schemes by the foolish fears of others.


To see yourself acrobating, you will have a sensation to answer for,
and your existence will be made almost unendurable by the guying
of your enemies.


To see women acrobating, denotes that your name will be maliciously
and slanderously handled. Also your business interests will be hindered.


For a young woman to dream that she sees acrobats in tights,
signifies that she will court favor of men.

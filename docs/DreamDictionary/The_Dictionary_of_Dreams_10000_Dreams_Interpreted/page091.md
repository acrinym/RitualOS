_Blood Stone_.

gain one more worthy of her.


_Blossoms_.


To dream of seeing trees and shrubs in blossom, denotes a time
of pleasing prosperity is nearing you.


_Blows_.


Denotes injury to yourself. If you receive a blow, brain trouble
will threaten you.


If you defend yourself, a rise in business will follow.


_Blotting Paper_.


To dream of using blotting paper, signifies you will be deceived
into the betrayal of secrets which will seriously involve a friend.


To see worn blotting paper, denotes continued disagreements in the home
or among friends.


_Blushing_.


For a young woman to dream of blushing, denotes she will be worried
and humiliated by false accusations. If she sees others blush,
she will be given to flippant railery which will make her unpleasing
to her friends.


_Boarding House_.


To dream of a boarding house, foretells that you will suffer
entanglement and disorder in your enterprises, and you are likely
to change your residence.

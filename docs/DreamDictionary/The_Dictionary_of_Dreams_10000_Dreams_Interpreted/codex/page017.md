>

> 
> 
> There are three pure types of dreams, namely, _subjective_,
> _physical_ and _spiritual_. They relate to the past,
> present and future, and are influenced by past or subjective,
> physical and spiritual causes. The latter is always deeply prophetic,
> especially when it leaves a vivid impression on the conscious mind.
> The former, too, possesses an element of warning and prophecy,
> though the true meaning is hidden in symbols or allegory.
> They are due to contingent mental pictures of the past
> falling upon the conscious mind of the dreamer.
> Thus he is back at the old home, and finds mother pale and aged,
> or ruddy and healthy, and the lawn withered or green.
> It all augurs, according to the aspect the picture assumes,
> ill or good fortune.
> 
> 
> Physical dreams are more or less unimportant. They are usually
> superinduced by the anxious waking mind, and when this is so they
> possess no prophetic significance.
> 
> 
> Dreams induced by opiates, fevers, mesmerism and ill health come under
> this class. A man who gambles is liable to dream of cards; if he dreams
> of them in deep sleep the warning is to be heeded; but if it comes
> as a reverie while he sleeps lightly he should regard it as worthless.
> Such dreams reflect only the present condition of the body and mind
> of the dreamer; but as the past and present enter into shaping the future,
> the reflections thus left on the waking mind should not go by unheeded.
> 
> 
> We often observe matters of dress and exterior appearance through mirrors,
> and we soon make the necessary alterations to put our bodies in harmony

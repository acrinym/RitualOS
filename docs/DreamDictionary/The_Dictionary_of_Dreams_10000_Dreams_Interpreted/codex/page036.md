> Nature is no sluggard and is forever changing her compounds,

🔁 Codex Interpretation:
A young woman of a certain age is warned in a dream of trouble likely to befall her, while another of similar age and threatened trouble is warned also, but in different symbols, which she fails to grasp and bring back to waking existence, and she thus believes she has had no warning dream. There are those in the world who lack subjective strength, material or spiritual, and hence they fail to receive dreams, however symbolic, because there is no power within them to retain these impressions. There are many reasons for this loss, utter material gross-ness, want of memory, physical weakness uncoupled from extreme nervousness,

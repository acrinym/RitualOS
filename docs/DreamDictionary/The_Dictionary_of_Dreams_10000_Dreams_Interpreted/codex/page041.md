🔁 Codex Interpretation:
Should it be securely fixed above you, so as not to imply danger, your condition will improve after threatened loss. No flower of purity will ever be too sacred for you to breathe a passionate breath upon. To dream that you have an abscess which seems to have reached a chronic stage, you will be overwhelmed with misfortune of your own; at the same time your deepest sympathies will be enlisted for the sorrows of others.

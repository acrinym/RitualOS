🔁 Codex Interpretation:
To put ice in one, brings the dreamer into disfavor. To dream that some one registers your name at a hotel for you, denotes you will undertake some work which will be finished by others. If she is irreligious and not a transgressor, it foretells that she will have that independent frankness and kind consideration for others, which wins for women profound respect, and love from the opposite sex as well as her own; but if she is a transgressor in the eyes of religion, she will find that there are moral laws, which, if disregarded, will place her outside the pale of honest recognition.

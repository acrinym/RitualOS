> This definition is untrue. There are two forces at work in man, one from
> within and the other from without. They are from two distinct spheres;
> the animal mind influenced by the personal world of carnal appetites,
> and the spiritual mind from the realm of universal Brotherhood,
> present antagonistic motives on the dream consciousness. If these two
> forces were in harmony, the spirit or mental picture from the dream
> mind would find a literal fulfilment in the life of the dreamer.
> The pleasurable sensations of the body cause the spirit anguish.
> The selfish enrichment of the body impoverishes the spirit influence upon
> the Soul. The trials of adversity often cause the spirit to rejoice
> and the flesh to weep. If the cry of the grieved spirit is left
> on the dream mind it may indicate to the dreamer worldly advancement,
> but it is hardly the theory of the occult forces, which have contributed
> to the contents of this book.

> 
> _Advertisement_.
> 
> 
> To dream that you are getting out advertisements, denotes that you
> will have to resort to physical labor to promote your interest,
> or establish your fortune.
> 
> 
> To read advertisements, denotes that enemies will overtake you,
> and defeat you in rivalry.
> 
> 
> _Advice_.
> 
> 
> To dream that you receive advice, denotes that you will be enabled to raise
> your standard of integrity, and strive by honest means to reach independent
> competency and moral altitude.

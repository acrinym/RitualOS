🔁 Codex Interpretation:
To get on one shows that travel which you held in contemplation will be made under different auspices than had been calculated upon. To ride on a car, foretells that rivalry and jealousy will enthrall your happiness. If priest or preacher is a spiritual adviser and his services are supposed to be needed, especially in the hour of temptation, then we find ourselves dreaming of him as a warning against approaching evil.

🔁 Codex Interpretation:
For a young woman to see an antelope miss its footing and fall from a height, denotes the love she aspires to will prove her undoing. Cold, or small, favors may be expected from those in power. If the anvil is broken, it foretells that you have, through your own neglect, thrown away promising opportunities that cannot be recalled.

🔁 Codex Interpretation:
This is often a very deceitful and misleading dream to the young woman of humble circumstances; as it is generally induced in such cases by the unhealthy day dreams of her idle, empty brain. She should strive after this dream, to live by honest work, and restrain deceitful ambition by observing the fireside counsels of mother, and friends. To dream of the palisades, denotes that you will alter well-formed plans to please strangers, and by so doing, you will impair your own interests.

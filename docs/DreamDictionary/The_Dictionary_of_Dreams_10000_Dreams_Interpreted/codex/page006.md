Write it as if it were being read aloud in a sacred dream chamber.
Link it to potential chakras, elements, and field dynamics.
Use poetic but grounded language.

🔁 Codex Interpretation:
``We are absolutely obliged to admit that SOMETHING emanated from the dying woman and touched her father-in-law. This _thing unknown_ may have been an ethereal movement, as in the case of light, and may have been only an effect, a product, a result; but this effect must have had a cause, and this cause evidently proceeded from the woman who was dying. I do not think that any anatomist or physiologist will give this question an affirmative answer.

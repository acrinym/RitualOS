**Codex, reinterpret this for RitualOS.**
Write it as if it were being read aloud in a sacred dream chamber.
Link it to potential chakras, elements, and field dynamics.
Use poetic but grounded language.
Highlight both shadow and light meanings.

🔁 Codex Interpretation:
``The soul, by its interior vision, may see not only what is passing at a great distance, but it may also know in advance what is to happen in the future. The future exists potentially, determined by causes which bring to pass successive events. ``What we call light is a sensation produced upon our optic nerve by the vibrations of ether, comprising between 400 and 756 trillions per second, undulations that are themselves very obscure.

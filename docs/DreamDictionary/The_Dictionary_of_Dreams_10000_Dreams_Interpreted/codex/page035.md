🔁 Codex Interpretation:
Possibilities for inner improvements or expansions rest with material man. If he entertains gross desires to the exclusion of spiritual germs, he will dwarf and degrade higher aspirations, and thus deprive subjective spirituality of her rightful possessions. A person's dream perception wavers, much as it does in waking hours.

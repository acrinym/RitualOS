Original:
> The former depend alone upon the voluptuous warmth of the world
> for contentment; they look to money, the presence of some one,
> or to other external sources for happiness, and are often disappointed;
> while the latter, with a just appreciation of temporal wants,
> depend alone upon the inner consciousness for that peace
> which passeth all carnal understanding.
> 
> 
> They are strengthened, as were Buddha and Christ, by suppressing
> the sensual fires for forty days and nights in the wilderness of trial
> and temptation. They number a few, and are never disappointed,
> while the former number millions.
> 
> 
> Nature is three-fold, so is man; male and female, son or soul.
> The union of one and two produce the triad or the trinity
> which underlies the philosophy of the ancients.
> 
> 
> Man has a physical or visible body, an atom of the physical or visible earth.
> He has a soul the exact counterpart of his body, but invisible and subjective;
> incomplete and imperfect as the external man, or _vice versa_.
> 
> 
> The soul is not only the son or creation of man, but it is the real man.
> It is the inner imperishable double or imprint of what has outwardly
> and inwardly transpired. All thoughts, desires and actions enter the soul
> through the objective mind.
> 
> 
> The automaton of the body responds as quickly to the bat
> of the eye as it does to the movement of the whole body.
> By it the foot-steps of man and the very hairs of his head are numbered.
> Thus it becomes his invisible counterpart. It is therefore the book
> of life or death, and by it he judges himself or is already judged.
> When it is complete nothing can be added or taken from its personnel.
> It is sometimes partly opened to him in his dreams, but in death
> is clearly revealed.
> 
> 
> Man has also a spiritual body, subjective to, and more ethereal
> than the soul. It is an infinitesimal atom, and is related
> in substance to the spiritual or infinite mind of the universe.
> Just as the great physical sun, the center of visible light,
> life and heat, is striving to purify the foul miasma of the marsh
> and send its luminous messages of love into the dark crevices
> of the earth, so the Great Spiritual Sun, of which the former
> is a visible prototype or reflection, is striving to illuminate

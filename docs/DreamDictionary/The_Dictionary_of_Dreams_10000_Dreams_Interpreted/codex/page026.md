🔁 Codex Interpretation:
After eliminating all contingencies arising from clerical error and counteracting influence, the prognostication is sure of fulfilment. In a like manner the subjective forces operate upon their own planes and know very little even of their own corporal realm, just as our physical senses know little, if anything, of the soul or spiritual habitation. Each may recognize and feel the violence or good that these manifestations will do to their respective counterparts, but we have no reason to believe that normal objective or subjective states have visional powers beyond their own plane.

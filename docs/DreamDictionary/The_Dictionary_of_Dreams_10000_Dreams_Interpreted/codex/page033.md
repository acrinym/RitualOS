🔁 Codex Interpretation:
A person can, if he will, completely relax his mind and body to the receptive mood required for dreams to appear as realities, or true explanations of future events. There is so little congeniality between common or material natures that persons should depend more largely upon their own subjectivity for true contentment and pleasure. Thus when images appear upon the dream vision they are frequently distorted into hideous malformations that fill it with fear and excitement.

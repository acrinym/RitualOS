> malformations of the most hideous type will seize your vision;
> shrouded in sheets of a whitish vapor, evanescent specters,
> with pallid face and of warning countenance, will cling around you,
> and contagion and famine will leave their desolate impress upon

> in spite of the inductive knowledge received through our senses--
> we go on from day to day, and step by step, feeding our soul

> Thus the soul is filled with thought images that assume the form

> cats and dogs, leprous and virile serpents, cankerous lizards,
> slimy intestine worms, hairy and malicious insects.
> They are generated by greed, envy, jealousy, covetousness, backbiting,

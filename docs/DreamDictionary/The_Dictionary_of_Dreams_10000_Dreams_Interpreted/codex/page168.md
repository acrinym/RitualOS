🔁 Codex Interpretation:
If the custard has a sickening sweet taste, or is insipid, nothing but sorrow will intervene where you had expected a pleasant experience. To dream of a custom-house, denotes you will have rivalries and competition in your labors. ``_God came to Laban, the Syrian, by night, in a dream, and said unto him, take heed that thou speak not to Jacob, either good or bad_.''

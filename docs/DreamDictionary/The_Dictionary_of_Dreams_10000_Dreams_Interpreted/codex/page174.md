🔁 Codex Interpretation:
Debt is rather a bad dream, foretelling worries in business and love, and struggles for a competency; but if you have plenty to meet all your obligations, your affairs will assume a favorable turn. To dream of being on a ship and that a storm is raging, great disasters and unfortunate alliances will overtake you; but if the sea is calm and the light distinct, your way is clear to success. To be decorating, or see others decorate for some heroic action, foretells that you will be worthy, but that few will recognize your ability.

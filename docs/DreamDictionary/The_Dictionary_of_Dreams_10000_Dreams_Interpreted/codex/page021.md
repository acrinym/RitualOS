> be interpreted by subjective intelligence_. This, though burdened
> with many business cares, I have honestly endeavored to do.
> Through the long hours of many nights I have waited patiently
> and passively the automatic movement of my hand to write
> the subjective definitions without receiving a word or a single
> manifestation of intelligence, and again the mysterious forces
> would write as fast as my hand could move over the paper.

> I will leave it for my readers to draw their own conclusions

> through the brain and intelligence of the medium, or the result

> It is argued by the Materialist, with some degree of strength,
> that the healthy man does not dream, This is, perhaps, true, in a way,
> but the whole man comprises the past, present, and future. The past
> and future always embrace more of the conditions that surround him than
> the present. The present is only the acute stage, while the chronic stage,
> considered from a personal view, is the past and future combined.
> Man cannot eliminate entirely these states from himself, for, while they
> are past and future to the personal mind, they are ever present
> to the higher subjective senses; he is, therefore, never in perfect
> health unless these states are in harmony with the present.
> The personal self, in a normal state, cannot free itself from the past
> or from the anxieties of the future.
> 
> 
> The reader should ever keep before his mind the fact that no man
> ever had the same dream twice. He may have had very similar dreams,
> but some detail will be missing. Nature seems to abhor duplicates.
> You could no more find two dreams alike than you could find facsimiles
> in two blades of grass. A man cannot live two days exactly alike.
> Different influences and passions will possess him. Consequently, no two
> dreams can be had under exactly the same influences. Stereotypes are
> peculiarly the invention of man and not of God or nature.
> 
> 
> Since it is impossible to find a man twice in exactly the same
> mental state, it is equally impossible for him to dream the same
> dream twice; therefore, it is only possible to approximate
> dream interpretation by classing them into families.
> This I have attempted to do in a more comprehensive way than
> other writers who have preceded me.

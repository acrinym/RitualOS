🔁 Codex Interpretation:
If well filled with ripe and matured grain, and perfect ears of corn, with fat stock surrounding it, it is an omen of great prosperity. If it is broken, you will find displeasing incidents in your business, arising unexpectedly. To dream that you are in a basement, foretells that you will see prosperous opportunities abating, and with them, pleasure will dwindle into trouble and care.

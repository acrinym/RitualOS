To dream that you feel joy over any event, denotes harmony among friends.


_Jubilee_.


To dream of a jubilee, denotes many pleasureable enterprises in which you
will be a participant. For a young woman, this is a favorable dream,
pointing to matrimony and increase of temporal blessings.


To dream of a religious jubilee, denotes close but comfortable environments.


_Judge_.


To dream of coming before a judge, signifies that disputes will be
settled by legal proceedings. Business or divorce cases may assume
gigantic proportions. To have the case decided in your favor,
denotes a successful termination to the suit; if decided against you,
then you are the aggressor and you should seek to right injustice.


_Judgment Day_.


To dream of the judgment day, foretells that you will accomplish some
well-planned work, if you appear resigned and hopeful of escaping punishment.
Otherwise, your work will prove a failure.


For a young woman to appear before the judgment bar and hear the verdict
of ``Guilty,'' denotes that she will cause much distress among her friends
by her selfish and unbecoming conduct. If she sees the dead rising,
and all the earth solemnly and fearfully awaiting the end, there will
be much struggling for her, and her friends will refuse her aid.
It is also a forerunner of unpleasant gossip, and scandal is threatened.
Business may assume hopeless aspects.


_Jug_.


If you dream of jugs well filled with transparent liquids,
your welfare is being considered by more than yourself.
Many true friends will unite to please and profit you.
If the jugs are empty, your conduct will estrange you from
friends and station.


Broken jugs, indicate sickness and failures in employment.

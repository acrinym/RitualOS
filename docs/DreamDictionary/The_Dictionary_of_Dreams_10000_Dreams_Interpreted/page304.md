_Jury_.


To dream that you are on the jury, denotes dissatisfaction
with your employments, and you will seek to materially
change your position.


If you are cleared from a charge by the jury, your business will be
successful and affairs will move your way, but if you should be condemned,
enemies will overpower you and harass you beyond endurance.


_Justice_.


To dream that you demand justice from a person, denotes that you
are threatened with embarrassments through the false statements
of people who are eager for your downfall.


If some one demands the same of you, you will find that your conduct
and reputation are being assailed, and it will be extremely doubtful
if you refute the charges satisfactorily.

_Kaleidoscope_.


Kaleidoscopes working before you in a dream, portend swift changes
with little of favorable promise in them.


_Kangaroo_.

you are striving to win.

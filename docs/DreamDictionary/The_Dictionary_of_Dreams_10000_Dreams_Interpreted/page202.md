For a lover to see an emerald or emeralds on the person of his affianced,
warns him that he is about to be discarded for some wealthier suitor.


To dream that you buy an emerald, signifies unfortunate dealings.


_Emperor_.


To dream of going abroad and meeting the emperor of a nation
in your travels, denotes that you will make a long journey,
which will bring neither pleasure nor much knowledge.


_Employee_.


To see one of your employees denotes crosses and disturbances
if he assumes a disagreeable or offensive attitude.
If he is pleasant and has communications of interest, you will
find no cause for evil or embarrassing conditions upon waking.


_Employment_.


This is not an auspicious dream. It implies depression
in business circles and loss of employment to wage earners.
It also denotes bodily illness.


To dream of being out of work, denotes that you will have no fear,
as you are always sought out for your conscientious fulfilment of contracts,
which make you a desired help.


Giving employment to others, indicates loss for yourself.
All dreams of this nature may be interpreted as the above.


_Empress_.


To dream of an empress, denotes that you will be exalted to high honors,
but you will let pride make you very unpopular.


To dream of an empress and an emperor is not particularly bad,
but brings one no substantial good.


_Enchantment_.

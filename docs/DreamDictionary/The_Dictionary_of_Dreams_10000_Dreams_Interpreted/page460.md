_Road_.


Traveling over a rough, unknown road in a dream, signifies new undertakings,
which will bring little else than grief and loss of time.


If the road is bordered with trees and flowers, there will be some
pleasant and unexpected fortune for you. If friends accompany you,
you will be successful in building an ideal home, with happy children
and faithful wife, or husband.


To lose the road, foretells that you will make a mistake in deciding
some question of trade, and suffer loss in consequence.


_Roast_.


To see or eat roast in a dream, is an omen of domestic infelicity
and secret treachery.


_Rocket_.


To see a rocket ascending in your dream, foretells sudden and
unexpected elevation, successful wooing, and faithful keeping
of the marriage vows.


To see them falling, unhappy unions may be expected.


_Rocking-chair_.


Rocking-chairs seen in dreams, bring friendly intercourse and contentment
with any environment.


To see a mother, wife, or sweetheart in a rocking chair,
is ominous of the sweetest joys that earth affords.


To see vacant rocking-chairs, forebodes bereavement or estrangement.
The dreamer will surely merit misfortune in some form.


_Rocks_.[192]


To dream of rocks, denotes that you will meet reverses,
and that there will be discord and general unhappiness.

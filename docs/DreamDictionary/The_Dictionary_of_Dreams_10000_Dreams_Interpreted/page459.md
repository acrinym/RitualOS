If you find yourself rising high into the air, you will come into unexpected
riches and pleasures, but you are warned to be careful of your engagements,
or you may incur displeasing prominence.


_Rival_.


To dream you have a rival, is a sign that you will be slow in asserting
your rights, and will lose favor with people of prominence.


For a young woman, this dream is a warning to cherish the love
she already holds, as she might unfortunately make a mistake
in seeking other bonds.


If you find that a rival has outwitted you, it signifies that you
will be negligent in your business, and that you love personal ease
to your detriment.


If you imagine that you are the successful rival, it is good for
your advancement, and you will find congeniality in your choice
of a companion.


_River_.


If you see a clear, smooth, flowing river in your dream,
you will soon succeed to the enjoyment of delightful pleasures,
and prosperity will bear flattering promises.


If the waters are muddy or tumultuous, there will be disagreeable
and jealous contentions in your life.


If you are water-bound by the overflowing of a river, there will
be temporary embarrassments in your business, or you will suffer
uneasiness lest some private escapade will reach public notice
and cause your reputation harsh criticisms.


If while sailing upon a clear river you see corpses in the bottom,
you will find that trouble and gloom will follow swiftly upon present
pleasures and fortune.


To see empty rivers, denotes sickness and unusual ill-luck.

will be worrying and profitless.


_Canal_.


To see the water of a canal muddy and stagnant-looking, portends
sickness and disorders of the stomach and dark designs of enemies.
But if its waters are clear a placid life and the devotion of friends
is before you.


For a young woman to glide in a canoe across a canal, denotes a chaste life
and an adoring husband. If she crossed the canal on a bridge over clear
water and gathers ferns and other greens on the banks, she will enjoy a life
of ceaseless rounds of pleasure and attain to high social distinction.
But if the water be turbid she will often find herself tangled in meshes
of perplexity and will be the victim of nervous troubles.


_Canary Birds_. To dream of this sweet songster, denotes
unexpected pleasures. For the young to dream of possessing
a beautiful canary, denotes high class honors and a successful
passage through the literary world, or a happy termination
of love's young dream.


To dream one is given you, indicates a welcome legacy.
To give away a canary, denotes that you will suffer disappointment
in your dearest wishes.


To dream that one dies, denotes the unfaithfulness of dear friends.


Advancing, fluttering, and singing canaries, in luxurious apartments,
denotes feasting and a life of exquisite refinement,
wealth, and satisfying friendships. If the light is weird
or unnaturally bright, it augurs that you are entertaining
illusive hopes. Your over-confidence is your worst enemy.
A young woman after this dream should beware, lest flattering
promises react upon her in disappointment. Fairy-like scenes
in a dream are peculiarly misleading and treacherous to women.


_Candles_.


To see them burning with a clear and steady flame, denotes the constancy
of those about you and a well-grounded fortune.

will feel for a time that you are immensely successful; but if
the large one bites you, enemies will steal away your good fortune.
If the little one bites you, you will be harassed with little spites
and jealousies. To imagine that you are running from a large spider,
denotes you will lose fortune in slighting opportunities.
If you kill the spider you will eventually come into fair estate.
If it afterwards returns to life and pursues you, you will be
oppressed by sickness and wavering fortunes.


For a young woman to dream she sees gold spiders crawling around her,
foretells that her fortune and prospect for happiness will improve,
and new friends will surround her.


_Spider-web_.


To see spider-webs, denotes pleasant associations and fortunate ventures.


_Spinning_.


To dream that you are spinning, means that you will engage in some enterprise,
which will be all you could wish.


_Spirit or Specter_.


To see spirits in a dream, denotes that some unexpected trouble will
confront you. If they are white-robed, the health of your nearest friend
is threatened, or some business speculation will be disapproving.
If they are robed in black, you will meet with treachery and unfaithfulness.


If a spirit speaks, there is some evil near you, which you might avert
if you would listen to the counsels of judgment.


To dream that you hear spirits knocking on doors or walls,
denotes that trouble will arise unexpectedly.


To see them moving draperies, or moving behind them, is a warning to hold
control over your feelings, as you are likely to commit indiscretions.
Quarrels are also threatened.


To see the spirit of your friend floating in your room,
foretells disappointment and insecurity.

threats of divorce will be made.


To see your face in a mirror, denotes displeasure with yourself
for not being able to carry out plans for self-advancement. You
will also lose the esteem of friends.


_Fagot_.


If you dream of seeing a dense smoke ascending from a pile of fagots,
it denotes that enemies are bearing down upon you, but if the fagots
are burning brightly, you will escape from all unpleasant complications
and enjoy great prosperity.


If you walk on burning fagots, you will be injured by the unwise actions
of friends. If you succeed in walking on them without being burned,
you will have a miraculous rise in prospects.


To dream of seeing fagots piled up to burn you at the stake,
signifies that you are threatened with loss, but if you escape,
you will enjoy a long and prosperous life.


_Failure_.


For a lover, this is sometimes of contrary significance.
To dream that he fails in his suit, signifies that he only needs
more masterfulness and energy in his daring, as he has already
the love and esteem of his sweetheart.


(Contrary dreams are those in which the dreamer suffers fear,
and not injury.)


For a young woman to dream that her life is going to be a failure,
denotes that she is not applying her opportunities to good advantage.


For a business man to dream that he has made a failure,
forebodes loss and bad management, which should be corrected,
or failure threatens to materialize in earnest.


_Fainting_.


To dream of fainting, signifies illness in your family and unpleasant
news of the absent.

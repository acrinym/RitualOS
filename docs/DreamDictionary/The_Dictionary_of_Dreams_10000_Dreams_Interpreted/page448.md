will bring failure to your plans.

condition of others.

_Ramble_.

will be oppressed with sadness, and the separation from friends,
but your worldly surroundings will be all that one could desire.
For a young woman, this dream promises a comfortable home,
but early bereavement.


_Ramrod_.

You will have cause for grief. For a young woman to see one bent
or broken, foretells that a dear friend or lover will fail her.

that you are deceived and worked for money on all sides.

pays the ransom and relieves her.

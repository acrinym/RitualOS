WHEN DREAMS ARE LESS PRESCIENT.



The cessation of the organs to perform healthful functions converts
a man into a different person, and dreams while in this state would
have no prophetic meaning, unless to warn the dreamer of this
disorganization of his physical system.


Dreams are symbols used by subjectivity to impress the objective
or material mind with a sense of coming good or evil. Subjectivity is
the spiritual part of man. The soul is that circle of man lying
just outside the gross materiality and partaking largely of it.
All thoughts and desires enter first the soul or material mind
and then cast themselves on the spirit. Frequently the soul becomes
so filled with material or present ideas, that the spiritual symbols
are crowded out, and then it is that dreams seen to be contrary.
Material subjectivity, that is, all thoughts and ideas emanating
from material sources, go to make up this circle; then the mind
catches up the better thoughts of this section and weaves them
into a broader and more comprehensive power, sustaining the owner
in his own judgment.


And still another circle is formed of the finer compound of this,
which is spiritual subjectivity, or the highest element of intelligence
reached by man. [This circle is ``the spiritual man'' and relates
in substance to the spiritual soul of the macrocosm or universe.
It becomes strong or weak as we recognize or fail to recognize
it as a factor of being. The process of spiritual development
is similar to that of the vegetable and animal kingdoms.
The trees on the outer rim of the forest are more capable of resisting
the wind than those more to the center, by reason of their exposure
to storms; the roots have penetrated with double strength far
into the earth, and the branches are braced with toughened bark
and closely knitted ligaments.


The same may be said of the animal kingdom. The mind is developed
by vigorous exercise just as are likewise the muscles of the body.
The more these are cultivated by drawing from their parental affinities
in the macrocosm, the more knowledge or power they take on.
Thus as a man simulates in thought and action an ape, a tiger, a goat,

in order to approach the material mind and make its
warning more effective.


To those who were interested in the teachings of Christ, but who after
his death were inclined to doubt him, this higher self materialized
in the form of the Great Master in order to impress on their material
minds the spiritual import of his teachings. So, to this day, when doubt
and temptation mar the moral instinct, God, through the spiritual self,
as Job says, approaches man while in deep sleep upon the bed to impress
his instructions that he may change man from his purpose.


The spiritual world always fixes its orbit upon a
straight line, while the material world is fonder of curves.
We find man struggling through dreadful marshes and deserts
of charlatanism in order to get a glimpse into his future,
instead of solicitously following the straight line of inner
consciousness that connects with the infinite mind, from which,
aided by his Church and the healthy action of his own judgment,
he may receive those helpful spiritual impressions and messages
necessary to solace the longings of the searching soul.


The philosophy of the True Master is the straight line.
Pythagoras, Plato and Christ created angles by running vertical lines
through the ecclesiastical and hypocritical conventionalities of their day.
The new angles and curves thus produced by the bold philosophy
of the humble Nazarene have confronted with impregnable firmness
during the intervening ages the sophistry of the Pharisees.


``In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men,
in slumberings upon the bed; then he openeth the ears of men and sealeth
their instruction. That he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide
pride from man.''--JOB 33:15.


``Man cannot contradict the laws of Nature. But, are all the laws
of Nature yet understood?''


``Real philosophy seeks rather to solve than to deny.''--LYTTON.


Those who live active lives exclude spiritual thought and
fill their minds with the fascinations of worldly affairs,
pleasure and business, dream with less frequency than
those who regard objective matters with lighter concern.

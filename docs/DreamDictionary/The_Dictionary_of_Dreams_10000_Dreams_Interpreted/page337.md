_Lizard_.


To dream of lizards, foretells attacks upon you by enemies.


If you kill a lizard, you will regain your lost reputation or fortune;
but if it should escape, you will meet vexations and crosses
in love and business.


For a woman to dream that a lizard crawls up her skirt,
or scratches her, she will have much misfortune and sorrow.
Her husband will be a victim to invalidism and she will be left
a widow, and little sustenance will be eked out by her own labors.


_Load_.


To dream that you carry a load, signifies a long existence filled
with labors of love and charity.


To fall under a load, denotes your inability to attain comforts
that are necessary to those looking to you for subsistence.


To see others thus engaged, denotes trials for them in which you
will be interested.


_Loadstone_.


To dream of a loadstone, denotes you will make favorable
opportunities for your own advancement in a material way.
For a young woman to think a loadstone is attracting her,
is an omen of happy changes in her family.


_Loaves_.


To dream of loaves of bread, denotes frugality. If they be of cake,
the dreamer has cause to rejoice over his good fortune, as love
and wealth will wait obsequiously upon you.


Broken loaves, bring discontent and bickerings between those who love.


To see loaves multiply phenomenally, prognosticates great success.
Lovers will be happy in their chosen ones.

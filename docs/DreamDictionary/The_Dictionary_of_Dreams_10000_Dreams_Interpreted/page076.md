To dream that you see John the Baptist baptizing Christ in the Jordan,
denotes that you will have a desperate mental struggle between yielding
yourself to labor in meagre capacity for the sustenance of others,
or follow desires which might lead you into wealth and exclusiveness.


To see the Holy Ghost descending on Christ, is significant of resignation
to duty and abnegation of self.

means that you will be thrown into a state of terror over being
discovered in some lustful engagement.

mode of advancement.


Seeing a bar, denotes activity in communities, quick uplifting of fortunes,
and the consummation of illicit desires.


_Barber_.


To dream of a barber, denotes that success will come through struggling
and close attention to business. For a young woman to dream of a barber,
foretells that her fortune will increase, though meagerly.


_Barefoot_.


To wander in the night barefoot with torn garments, denotes that you
will be crushed in expectation, and evil influences will surround
your every effort.


_Barley-field_.


The dreamer will obtain his highest desires, and every effort
will be crowned with success. Decay in anything denotes loss.


_Barmaid_.


For a man to dream of a barmaid, denotes that his desires run
to low pleasures, and he will scorn purity.

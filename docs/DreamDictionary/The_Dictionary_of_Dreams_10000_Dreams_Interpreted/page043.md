burden herself with unwelcome cares. If she falls into the abyss
her disappointment will be complete; but if she succeeds in crossing,
or avoiding it, she will reinstate herself.


_Academy_.


To visit an academy in your dreams, denotes that you will regret opportunities
that you have let pass through sheer idleness and indifference.


To think you own, or are an inmate of one, you will find that you
are to meet easy defeat of aspirations. You will take on knowledge,
but be unable to rightly assimilate and apply it.


For a young woman or any person to return to an academy after having
finished there, signifies that demands will be made which the dreamer
may find himself or her self unable to meet.


_Accepted_.[6]


For a business man to dream that his proposition has been accepted,
foretells that he will succeed in making a trade, which heretofore
looked as if it would prove a failure.


For a lover to dream that he has been accepted by his sweetheart,
denotes that he will happily wed the object of his own
and others' admiration.


[6] If this dream has been occasioned by overanxiety and weakness,
the contrary may be expected. The elementary influences often play
pranks upon weak and credulous minds by lying, and deceptive utterances.
Therefore the dreamer should live a pure life, fortified by a strong will,
thus controlling his destiny by expelling from it involuntary intrusions.


_Accident_.


To dream of an accident is a warning to avoid any mode of travel
for a short period, as you are threatened with loss of life.


For an accident to befall stock, denotes that you will struggle
with all your might to gain some object and then see some friend
lose property of the same value in aiding your cause.

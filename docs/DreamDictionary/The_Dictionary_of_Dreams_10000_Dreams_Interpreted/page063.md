_Apparition_.


Take unusual care of all depending upon you. Calamity awaits you and yours.
Both property and life are in danger. Young people should be
decidedly upright in their communications with the opposite sex.
Character is likely to be rated at a discount.


_Apples_.


This is a very good dream to the majority of people.


To see red apples on trees with green foliage is exceedingly propitious
to the dreamer.


To eat them is not as good, unless they be faultless.
A friend who interprets dreams says: ``Ripe apples on a tree,
denotes that the time has arrived for you to realize your hopes;
think over what you intend to do, and go fearlessly ahead.
Ripe on the top of the tree, warns you not to aim too high.
Apples on the ground imply that false friends, and flatterers
are working you harm. Decayed apples typify hopeless efforts.''


_Apprentice_.


To dream that you serve as an apprentice, foretells you will have a struggle
to win a place among your companions


_Apricot_.


Dreams of seeing apricots growing, denote that the future, though seemingly
rosy hued, holds masked bitterness and sorrow for you.


To eat them signifies the near approach of calamitous influences.
If others eat them, your surroundings will be unpleasant
and disagreeable to your fancies. A friend says:
``Apricots denote that you have been wasting time over trifles
or small things of no value.''


_April_.

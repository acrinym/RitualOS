_Devotion_.


For a farmer to dream of showing his devotion to God, or to
his family, denotes plenteous crops and peaceful neighbors.
To business people, this is a warning that nothing is to be
gained by deceit.


For a young woman to dream of being devout, implies her chastity
and an adoring husband.


_Devil_.


For farmers to dream of the devil, denotes blasted crops and death
among stock, also family sickness. Sporting people should heed
this dream as a warning to be careful of their affairs, as they are
likely to venture beyond the laws of their State. For a preacher,
this dream is undeniable proof that he is over-zealous, and should
forebear worshiping God by tongue-lashing his neighbor.


To dream of the devil as being a large, imposingly dressed person,
wearing many sparkling jewels on his body and hands, trying to
persuade you to enter his abode, warns you that unscrupulous
persons are seeking your ruin by the most ingenious flattery.
Young and innocent women, should seek the stronghold of friends after
this dream, and avoid strange attentions, especially from married men.
Women of low character, are likely to be robbed of jewels and money
by seeming strangers.


Beware of associating with the devil, even in dreams. He is always
the forerunner of despair. If you dream of being pursued by his majesty,
you will fall into snares set for you by enemies in the guise of friends.
To a lover, this denotes that he will be won away from his allegiance
by a wanton.


_Dew_.


To feel the dew falling on you in your dreams, portends that
you will be attacked by fever or some malignant disease;
but to see the dew sparkling through the grass in the sunlight,
great honors and wealth are about to be heaped upon you.
If you are single, a wealthy marriage will soon be your portion.

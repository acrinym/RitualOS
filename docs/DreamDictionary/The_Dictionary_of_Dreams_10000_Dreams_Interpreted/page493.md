_Snakes_.[210]


For a woman to dream that a dead snake is biting her, foretells she
will suffer from malice of a pretended friend.


To dream of snakes, is a foreboding of evil in its various forms and stages.


To see them wriggling and falling over others, foretells struggles
with fortune and remorse.


To kill them, you will feel that you have used every opportunity
of advancing your own interests, or respecting that of others.
You will enjoy victory over enemies.


To walk over them, you will live in constant fear of sickness, and selfish
persons will seek to usurp your place in your companion's life.


If they bite you, you will succumb to evil influences, and enemies
will injure your business.


To dream that a common spotted snake approaches you from green herbs,
and you quickly step aside as it passes you, and after you had forgotten
the incident to again see it approaching and growing in dimensions
as it nears you, finally taking on the form of an enormous serpent;
if you then, after frantic efforts, succeed in escaping its attack,
and altogether lose sight of it, it foretells that you will soon
imagine you are being disobeyed and slighted, and things will go on
from bad to worse. Sickness, uneasiness and unkindness will increase
to frightful proportions in your mind; but they will adjust themselves
to a normal basis, and by the putting aside of imaginary trouble,
and masterfully shouldering duties, you will be contented and repaid.

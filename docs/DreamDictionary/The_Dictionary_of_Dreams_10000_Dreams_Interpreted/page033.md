of course, have to be cultivated by the subject). A person can,
if he will, completely relax his mind and body to the receptive
mood required for dreams to appear as realities, or true
explanations of future events.

To dream you are conversing with a dead relative, and that
relative endeavors to extract a promise from you, warns you
of coming distress unless you follow the advice given.
Disastrous consequences could be averted if minds could grasp
the inner workings and sight of the higher or spiritual self.
The voice of relatives is only that higher self taking form to approach
more distinctly the mind that lives near the material plane.
There is so little congeniality between common or material
natures that persons should depend more largely upon their own
subjectivity for true contentment and pleasure.

DREAMS EXAGGERATED.



The will is suspended during sleep, so the dream mind is more a prey
to excitability than the waking mind.


Thus when images appear upon the dream vision they are frequently distorted
into hideous malformations that fill it with fear and excitement.



CONTRARY DREAMS.



The constant dwelling of the mind upon certain things distorts
their shapes upon subjectivity, thus throwing dreams in exactly
opposite channels to the waking reality. Yet the dreamer always
feels a sense of being awake in dreams like these, and on awakening
experiences no recuperation of mind or body after such contrary dreams,
Sleep is not fully sustained while the dreamer is held by material
ideas in the subjective state.

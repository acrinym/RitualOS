_Awake_.


To dream that you are awake, denotes that you will experience
strange happenings which will throw you into gloom.


To pass through green, growing fields, and look upon landscape,
in your dreams, and feel that it is an awaking experience,
signifies that there is some good and brightness in store for you,
but there will be disappointments intermingled between the present
and that time.


_Axe_.


Seeing an axe in a dream, foretells that what enjoyment
you may have will depend on your struggles and energy.
To see others using an axe, foretells, your friends will be
energetic and lively, making existence a pleasure when near them.


For a young woman to see one, portends her lover will be worthy,
but not possessed with much wealth. A broken or rusty axe,
indicates illness and loss of money and property.




B. ``_God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,
`Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman thou hast taken;
for she is a man's wife_.''--Gen. xx., 3rd.


_Baby_.


To dream of crying babies, is indicative of ill health and disappointments.


A bright, clean baby, denotes love requited, and many warm friends.
Walking alone, it is a sure sign of independence and a total ignoring
of smaller spirits. If a woman dream she is nursing a baby,
she will be deceived by the one she trusts most.


It is a bad sign to dream that you take your baby if sick with fever.
You will have many sorrows of mind.

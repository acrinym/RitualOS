# RitualOS Offline Roadmap

This document outlines short-term goals for RitualOS that do not rely on cloud APIs or mobile platforms. Everything listed here is designed to work fully offline.

## 1. Improved Theme Customization
- [x] Expand the `themes/` folder with additional color palettes
- [x] Add a Theme Picker dialog so users can preview themes before applying them
- [x] Document how to create custom themes in the `docs/` folder

## 2. Enhanced Analytics
- [ ] Extend `AnalyticsViewModel` to display ritual frequency by moon phase
- [ ] Include local stats about ingredient usage
- [ ] Provide export options for CSV and Markdown reports

## 3. Plugin Growth
- [ ] Build more example plugins in the `plugins/` directory
- [ ] Outline plugin development in `docs/plugin_system.md`
- [ ] Encourage community contributions for tarot spreads, astrology tools, and more

## 4. Data Import & Export
- [ ] Add wizards for importing existing ritual logs
- [ ] Support exporting all data to a single JSON bundle
- [ ] Keep operations offline, relying only on file reads and writes

## 5. Community Templates
- [ ] Offer a curated set of ritual templates in `samples/`
- [ ] Highlight recent additions in the main dashboard
- [ ] Allow users to share templates via local files without a server

These milestones will breathe new life into the project while honoring the current offline-first focus. They also pave the way for future online features when infrastructure becomes available.
